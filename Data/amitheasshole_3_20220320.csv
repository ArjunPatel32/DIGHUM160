t4eh7s,1646158825.0,2022-03-01,False,Open Forum,,AITAMod,AITA Monthly Open Forum March 2022,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

~~I didn't prepare anything for this month. I was busy letting a toddler use me as a human shield in a fierce nerf gun battle with his brother. #NoRegrets. We'll edit something in later.~~

Rule 3: Accept your judgement. Perhaps our most abused and misunderstood rule. Let’s talk about it.

#What does ""Accept your Judgement"" mean:

Accept your judgement doesn't mean that OP has to agree with the judgement. It simply means that OP needs to understand that a judgement has been given and it's not their place to debate it here.""

#First, why do we have it? Three key reasons.

* To prevent /r/changemyview style discussions. We’re not here to debate broad views, we’re here to discuss the implications of actions. So if you’re looking for a structured environment to debate your personal philosophy, we’re not it.

* Some OPs come here for validation and don’t receive it. They’re not supposed to be buttmuches about it. While it’s perfectly fine to clarify and add new information, we’re not here for your *”Ok, but…”* or your *“OH SO I GUESS IT’S FINE IF YOU…”*. Sometimes you’re going to learn you were in fact the asshole. Don’t post here if that’s not something you’re comfortable with.

* To keep participants from getting unchecked nasty replies, or to be drawn into an unwanted debate when OP doesn't like the answer. ***It is not a metaphorical stick to beat a ‘YTA’ OP with.*** This is where the abuse comes in. We get *a lot* of folks here that think, when someone is an asshole in a situation, they shouldn’t exist beyond serving as an outlet for your frustration. This makes *you* the asshole. 

To follow rule 3, OP simply needs to keep their comments limited to clarifying, and providing new information. Questions from OP should be limited, and only for when there's genuine confusion. While it fosters a better discussion, **OP does not have to comment at all.**


#Let’s cover some dos and don’ts for everyone else.


Do | Don't
---|---
Ask questions if you’re confused (INFO tag exists for this). | Comment things like ""accept your judgement"" or ""rule 3."" Simply report it.
Upvote the answers for visibility, even when you hate it. | Report an OP you just don’t like, but who is participating within our rules.
Accept OP can participate within the context of our rules. | Report someone other than OP for rule 3 (lol, seriously?)
Report an OP that is breaking the rules | Be uncivil because someone is not accepting their judgement. The two do not cancel each other out. Report it and walk away.

#Finally, how do we enforce rule 3?

1. We warn. Not every time. If they’re particularly egregious and/or breaking other rules (usually “be civil”) in the process, we may skip the warning.
1. We ban. Typically for 1-3 days – just enough to keep OP from engaging in the thread while its active.
1. We remove the thread. We REALLY don’t like to do this for rule 3. It’s generally reserved for OPs who pull crazy nonsense like editing their post to continue the convo, make another throwaway, etc. We like the keep the thread active so, hopefully, a calmer OP can reflect on their feedback later and reconsider.

With this in mind, one thing you could do to help us is **get into the habit of noticing when OP commented last.** Was it 5 minutes ago, just a few comments removed from the mod warning? Report that shit! Was it 7 hours ago and they haven't commented since? Then the issue has likely been resolved.

#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.",507,0.95,,3595,799,"The validation posts are so tedious.

""Person committed a felony against me, and I'm upset. AITA?"" 

""Person stole from me, and I got mad. AITA?"" 

If someone has been so abused in such a hardcore way that they literally cannot figure out proper morality, I don't understand how anyone thinks this subreddit is supposed to help them with that. Beyond that, I don't understand how or why anyone thinks these types of posts belong here. Boggles my mind. I love this sub but feel that whenever someone dares to go against the group concensus people are very quick to get personal in their rebuttals. I think it should be kept to the issue at hand and commenters shouldn't be insulting each other. We're here to judge op, not each other! Just a question but has anyone else felt like a few of the really upvoted posts recently have had a “subliminal marketing” feel? There was the one about the person wanting to work four-hours a week at a specific gym just to get a free membership because it was “basically a resort”, then at least two posts about “controversial” dresses where they had a link to the dress itself. As this sub continues to grow in popularity I could see this becoming a real issue. There have been way to many sus posts lately. I think the sub is just a karma farm at this point. Posts with sus names, odd history (not just throwaways), posts where OP never responds. Honestly, I get that not all the stories are going to be true, but I’m finding it harder and harder to believe that even 10% of them are true. It almost feels like there is a list of popular topics and a formula for making a successful post. Didn't there used to be a rule about posts needing to be about a current conflict? I saw a post about a conflict that the OP said happened a few years ago and I looked at the rules because I thought there was one about it needing to be current but didn't see one. The frequency at which people simply leave their young children on the doorsteps of people who are not expecting them is insanely high if you're taking surveys of how people behave from this subreddit. 

I've literally never heard of this happening, anywhere, ever, and yet we see that story weekly here, sometimes twice a week. I keep seeing a pattern in AITA posts and I am wondering if it only happens here or in does it really happen in the real world.  I am talking about family involvement in an argument between between a couple.  The story inevitably ends with the guy’s mother calling and telling off the wife or her mother calling and berating him. 

That is incredibly surprising to me as neither my wife’s family nor my family would ever dream of stepping in between a couple. 

Does this really happen ? Speculation has gotten out of hand. Too many commenters are assuming or fantasizing of things that ""could"" have happened but in no way have been mentioned by the O.P Apologies if this is too tangential but I commented on an AITA post earlier and immediately received a message from a subreddit that I’m not subscribed to telling me I’m banned from participating in their sub because apparently they consider AITA (and other subs) ‘problematic’.  Is this normal on Reddit? They reported me for harassment after I told them to fuck off for messaging me and banning me for merrily going about my day and harmlessly posting in whatever subs I want. Surely messaging everyone who posts in AITA should be considered harassment? How on earth anyone believed that 'husband tied up my dog and left it outside' post is beyond me.  Just looking at the picture that dog was definitely tied there for two seconds for a picture.  There's no poop around the dog, it doesn't look bothered at all? I'm curious as to how common it really is for someone to ask someone for an apology. This is one of the weirder occurrences I see on this subreddit. Just here to opine (once again) that no one here actually likes their spouse.

""But Superb, you only have one biased side of the story and you don't see the good things!""

OK and? *Barring abusive/toxic relationships*, maybe if y'all actually cared about the people you *married*, you wouldn't gleefully trash them to a bunch of Internet strangers and then refuse to clarify when said strangers think your spouse is a toxic monster (because who *wouldn't* think a whiny gambling-addicted husband with less emotional maturity than Biff Tannen is a tool?). I don’t like how this sub has changed to the point where the top comments aren’t even contributions to the discussion. It’s all just wise crack jokes, terrible one-liners and dog piling. Whatever happened to best of 2021? a ""FAKE"" vote would be nice It's kind of wild how much people on here project onto these posts. You'll get like, four paragraphs about one interpersonal conflict, that's generally heavily biased in OP's favor to begin with, and have people using that to invent this whole long, overly detailed, destructive pattern of behavior they've decided the designated AH has been engaging in, without a scrap of evidence.

""Your husband yelled at you once? That must mean he yells all the time, which means he beats you, which means he beats you with a belt, sometimes with a wrench, and if he's willing to beat his wife, he's probably spending his down time sitting in a lawn chair on the front porch, binge drinking and screaming racial obscenities at the neighbors, and if he's a wife-beating racist, oh my God, he probably hurts your kids too. AND HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN DO CHORES!! OP, take your children and divorce him immediately!!!"" I know [reality is unrealistic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic), but can we agree it's extraordinarily unlikely that someone will actually demand another person given them a newborn baby and will somehow manage to get other people to act as their flying monkeys over it? Am I the only one who's noticed the amount of posts in the last month or 2 where OP befriends their girlfriend of fiancé's bully or the bullies friends and expects their partner to leave their past behind and be ok with it! ""Never delete an active discussion"" is one of the Report reasons listed. Not sure I even get what that would be used for, but is it even necessary?

Reason I ask is that if I remember right, there are a limited number of Report reasons that can be shown. So that one is taking space from other, better reasons being a choice. Recently a lot of posts just seem.. fake?? I feel like these stories are getting more and more insane I am amazed lately how 'pranks' that have gone wrong have serious consequences.   
i'm not talking about consequences - but what people consider to be a ""prank"". 

The guy that stood up at his friend's (groom) wedding and said the woman he was marrying was a cheater - Prank - no, i don't think so. 

There's another one i read yesterday, but i can't find it.   
Just today - the guy that hid his bil's hearing aid and damaged it. Do not fuck with someone else's medical device. 

a prank is something that makes people laugh - not something that has life altering consequences. I don't know for anyone else but the majority of posts I've read lately seems like very obvious YTA/NTA situations which makes me feel like they're karmafarming posts. Has this sub always been like this? The amount of recent posts I'm seeing about autistic people remind me of smear posts about trans people that used to happen. The posts are written in a way where nobody would consider that the OP could ever be the asshole, and the person being autistic rarely has any relevance to the conflict. 

I'm willing to bet a majority of these posts are fake just like all those posts about trans people were fake. There is just no way that there happens to be a significantly large group of people that all recently had a conflict with an autistic person where the autistic person was downright cruel, and that they all coincidentally came to this subreddit to ask about it. 

Is there anything to be done about this, and smear posting in general? I felt alienated before as a trans person and was very happy when those kinds of posts died down, but now I feel alienated again as a disabled person. I am often concerned about this subs support for revenge as if that’s a thing that a mentally healthy adult should ever worry about. So many times OP does or says something terrible in response to being wronged and they get pats on the back, but it’s such a toxic way of looking at the world. Apparently it’s “ridiculous cultural appropriation week” on AITA. Two language learning stories and now a white guy who likes the blues. I wonder how many are creative writing. In a story with only 2 relevant people

Commenter - ""YTA for xyz reason""

Reply - ""How is person B also not an asshole?""

Commenter - ""Well they are.. blah blah blah""

Rinse and repeat literally dozens of times a day. Can we report them for not knowing ESH exists? This is second only to people saying ""YTA for not breaking up with x"" in my personal pet peeve category Anyone else just see a uterus when they see a small version of the AITA profile pic on mobile? I cannot see anything else What can we do about posts that are *clearly* NTA

Like half the posts are like: ""I kicked my boyfriend out after he murdered my entire family, AITA?"" 

A lot of posts seems so far fetched too. This sub wasn't always like this Love the posts that say ""I'll accept my judgement"", or ""I'm prepared for any backlash,"" and when they don't get the expected validation or sympathy, the post gets deleted. Quick Q - is there a way to unhide or find a post again after hiding it? I'm on mobile, and idk if they're changed the layout or something but recently I jsut keep hitting hise post instead of report!

Like just how, there a post with a few 100 upvotes where the conflict essentially revolves around sexual assault (therefore all the comments have turned into debates about women falsely accusing men, etc), but I accidentally hid it and cant find it again ;o; Does anyone else ever see posts that they want to report multiple times because of just how badly they break multiple rules, or is that just me? Last's month's ""3 points"" that are necessary for interpersonal conflict were pretty clear (and probably disqualify a lot of threads).

Does the Summary Bot email that you send to the OP reflect those points? Seems like it might help if they had to specifically answer 1)What action did you take in the conflict? 2)What was the other party's response? 3)Why do you think you might be an asshole?

There have been several threads recently where it's revealed only in the OP's comments that the other person doesn't know there's a problem and hasn't said anything about the situation. Since Rule 3 removals/locks have to be done manually, is it possible the post could also get the Asshole flair added? It seems to me that if someone is arguing their judgement, they probably deserve it and they probably would've got it anyways. I find Fatphobia really intense here. Whenever a story involves a fat person being given a ""reality check"" by an OP the comments are so hateful and full of things like THEY NEED TO KNOW THEY'RE KILLING THEMSELVES

1. Why is there never any questioning about how overweight the person is? It's not so simple as fat=death loool

2. Why is there never any questioning about the fat person's mental health? Disordered eating? If the post was about someone who was displaying signs of anorexia and OP was like ""I just told her to eat more!! She needs a reality check!!"" I feel there would be so many people going ""get her help! Maybe she's anorexic! Have her see a doctor!"" But when it's a fat person it's just like YEAH EAT LESS MOVE MORE!! as if fat people are so stupid they don't know that already. I’m always troubled to see posts from kids on here (16 ish or under). I can only imagine the comments they get Is there any way to link the mod’s autogenerated copy of a deleted post to the top of the comments when a post has been deleted, so you don’t have to go searching for it? Small complaint, but I’m just curious? Not sure how unpopular this opinion is, but the reason why people ""always"" jump to breakup/divorce/leave them/no contact in this sub is bc the posts that get popular are the ones with the assholes that do enough to warrant a breakup/divorce/being left/no contact.

Edit: added nc to examples Y'all really hate addicts here. It really feels like people have a warped view of parenthood sometimes and what is required of a stay-at-home parent. It is entirely possible for someone to be a stay-at-home parent, even of an infant, and have some time to nap during the day. It's entirely possible for them to have time to do some chores. Parenting, even with babies and infants, does not mean that you have to be staring at the child all day every day and that you're incapable of doing anything else. Is it easy? No, but neither is it as hard as you might think from the comments people make whenever there's a division of labor question involving a child.

Drives me mad when people are like ""well, being a parent is a 24/7 job and the one who works outside the home is getting a break and when does the other parent get a break?"" I dunno dude, but no one in this conversation is going about this in a constructive way. I just got told that it's perfectly okay for a teenager to intentionally hurt his mother because she cheated on his dad years ago. Holy fuck is this subreddit morally bankrupt sometimes. Has there been a recent influx of clear non assholes or has it always been this way.  I swear it seems like I read multiple posts a day that are basically ""Aita for being abused"" or similar levels ridiculous questions. What is the obsession with accusing people of being the person a OP is talking about just because of a disagreement. It's really getting old. What's with all the posts about naming children? Four on the front page right now.. Now that I think about it, there often seems to be a ""when it rains, it pours"" effect with regards to certain themes and topics. Is this an indication of potential fake posts? Trolls trying to capitalize on a hot topic? I may be way off the mark but I feel like there was some rogue mod drama behind the scenes a month or so ago? For a while posts kept getting deleted/locked for reasons that had nothing to do with the post. E.g. posts removed for 'violence' when there was zero mention of violence, posts removed for breaking the 'no partings' rule when it was an argument about chores between dad and son. (Nothing I personally posted, just a trend I noticed)

Started noticing it around late Jan, but it seems to have stopped as of a few weeks ago.

Or maybe I just spend too much time on here. Did... did I miss the 2021 best of awards? I remember seeing the voting but not the awards I am really struck by how many people are asking ""AItA?"" for setting reasonable and appropriate boundaries. I think the entire population of r/childfree came to comment on that baby crying post. The lack of compassion in the comments is horrifying. can people stop voting “ESH, you for not leaving” on things where the person writing has a clearly abusive partner? it’s literally blaming the victim for being abused. Dear God the dead baby posts are making a comeback 😨

This is worst than the fecal fetishists and the period and piss fetishists I may have just missed it, but do y'all keep, track, and/or report statistics for the various judgments? What about further granularity, like disagreeing judgments within posts? Hello!

I would like to ask if there was some change the sub's timeout algo? I am getting timed out but I dunno why. I checked I haven't been downvoted lately and I should have thousands of karma here (I dunno how to check) I've seen some posts taken down with a blurb saying something like ""If you have an eating disorder or are struggling with self harm,"" is there a best item to report these posts under to get that response in particular? Did I miss the winners of best of 2021? I see the occasional situation where somebody once to know if they're the asshole for getting in a final dig at someone who has been abominable to them.  At times, I really want to go, ""No, you are not the asshole for your comment.  But really, was your bon mot necessary or productive, beyond making you feel good for getting the last word in?"" >Upvote the answers for visibility, even when you hate it.  
>  
>Accept OP can participate within the context of our rules.	

This is not a thing that people do on this sub Ngl, I find the level of downvotes that are given out on here kind of hysterical, sometimes. It’s kind of like a badge of honour to see what relatively tame comment can provoke people’s ire to keep pounding downvote to ridiculous amounts. 

It kinda indicates a problem with the community, though. For me it’s funny, for someone with a couple of thousand karma, getting that many downvotes can make them give up on participating. I've seen assholes who didn't know they were assholes, assholes who were positive they weren't, assholes who were okay with it, and assholes who doubled down, but I have never seen someone on this sub act so much like a cartoon villain as the OP for that house selling post. Can mods start posting the original text of the post towards the top of the comments? That way we don’t have to scroll past (sometimes) hundreds of other comments just to find out what the post said For a sub that’s geared towards “The Moral Philosopher” I feel like there’s a very shallow understanding of what philosophy entails. I won’t lie and say I am some great philosopher, but from taking philosophy classes in college I’ve come to understand some fundamental things. Philosophy requires a sense of empathy, nuance, and the ability to challenge your own ideals, all three of those ideas are shockingly absent in this sub. It’s especially worrisome when comments that do contain empathy, nuance, or go against the grain are downvoted and hidden from other viewers. 

I also find it extremely ironic when someone is voted to be an AH but when you check the comments section 99% of commenters are being bigger AHs than the OP. why are there unnecessary nsfw or spoiler flairs on posts? I'd say we need a discussion on rule 5 next week, centered on what it means and how it's applied, but I don't think anyone creating posts that break it will ever stick their noses in here. Any chance of adding a way of flagging repeat posts? There increasingly seems to be some users/ bots just posting variations on the same rubbish over and over. Or are they just classed as Shitposts? After having contest mode on this thread for so long, I now understand why people don't like the idea of having it on actual judgement threads for 18 hours. I still think it should be on for more than an hour. Maybe 3 or 4? Evening all,I’m back for another rant 😂

&#x200B;

So it’s amazing how many of the stories here involve people ‘storming off’ or ‘storming out’. I mean, do people actually speak like that? I can’t imagine having a conversation in real life that involves someone STORMING OFF. Do people not just, like, leave the room or walk away any more?

It reminds me of those shitty women’s magazines you find at the dentist where all the (clearly fictional) stories ‘my HUSBAND eloped with my HAMSTER so now I’m MARRIED to a CAT!!!’ have their cutesy wee phrases. So instead of ‘I was crying’ it’s ‘tears sprang to my lashes’. Seriously, I’m cringing so hard just typing that out.

&#x200B;

And what was even more amazing was that in every.single.story that phrase was in there somewhere:

&#x200B;

\- ’when my son got his invitation from Hogwarts, proud tears sprang to my lashes’

&#x200B;

\- ’when I caught my best friend shagging my dishwasher, angry tears sprang to my lashes’

&#x200B;

\- ‘when my daughter gave birth to a penguin, happy tears spra-…ok, I refuse to write that utter drivel again, I’ve already cringed myself inside out here.

&#x200B;

It’s an interesting wee pattern to spot. Because who even talks like that? Except, of course, the people working for said shitty magazines who are maxing out their creative writing ‘skillz’. Which brings us neatly back to all the STORMING going on in here. I can’t help but notice all the storming and it’s making me wonder.

&#x200B;

Thoughts, anyone? Am I just in cantankerous b!tch mode again (entirely possible lol) or do people actually STORM OFF or STORM OUT of places these days? I’m getting up in years a bit so I dunno what words are ‘cool’ any more. I feel like this sub has become a toxic hate group with a herd/cult like mentality, not a place people can get judgement in. Okay but like, who won the nerf battle? Suggestion: You shouldn't be able to comment on a story if you're read other comments.

Read the submission, make your judgement, then read everybody else's comments.  Too many of these submissions seem to just blindly follow the top ranked comment.

If OP wants to add new information, they can edit the submission, not bury it in a comment somewhere. Honestly the dogpiling on an asshole OP is so annoying.  This one guy was ruled the asshole and got horribly downvoted on everything even an innocuous comment about how their autocorrect changed 'tics' to 'tricks' in their post and that they fixed it. I’ve been getting more and more concerned about the deleting/locking of posts. 

In some cases - mainly the troll ones - I’ll accept that the mods maybe have more information than I do. And so there is potentially a justification that I can’t see.

But the most recent one I noted was the lass asking whether she was the asshole for not doing a vaginal exam. It was locked because it broke the relationships rule. 

The only link to relationships was that it was a vagina issue. But vaginas are a standard part of every female anatomy. And the OP was asking about a medical issue.

If this was the only time I’d seen this apparently heavy handed moderation, I wouldn’t say anything. But I’m noticing it more frequently and this is just the most recent example.

I do want to say that I’ve never been a mod. I’ve never had to deal with the crap that you guys deal with on a daily basis. I don’t know how this works and I’m willing to be corrected if you think I’m barking up the wrong tree. Can I ask how the mods determined that the one about the guy finding his daughter’s OnlyFans was a shitpost? I mean, I’m not surprised, but I’d love to hear how you found out. Friendly reminder that if it were possible to put unmarried fathers on a birth certificate without their knowledge or cooperation (or somebody committing fraud) celebrities and billionaires would be in court every day of their lives fighting off claims. Stories where this happens are either really really old or fake as hell. Downvotes:

I have seen a number of comments in this thread about downvotes.

Dogpiling and being downvoted for having an unorthodox opinion seem to be the primary (and completely valid) complaints.

I am curious what the people reading this think is a justifiable reason to downvote a comment. I do not mean the OP, I mean in the comments.

For myself, I tend to downvote things that are just plain wrong or exceptionally stupid. A difference of opinion isnt enough for me.

An example: I downvoted a comment a few days ago that read words to the effect of ""I know someone who is autistic and collect things. So most autistic people collect things, therefore it is likely that anyone who collects things is autistic"".

I mean - well done for packing so many logical fallacies into so few words, but still. There is a line.

I also downvote things for containing offensive cliches:

""My SO has a valid but different opinion on the Marvel Universe""

""Red flags!""; ""Therapy!""; ""They are gaslighting you!""; ""When they show you who they are, believe them""; ""Divorce them!"".

Fuck that. Lots of AHs posting this evening. I love it! That said, I’ve noticed that there are three kinds:
1) The soft ones, where there’s room to learn and grow.
2) The sharp ones, where say an apology is immediately warranted.
3) The “Get outta here” ones. 

All in all, some interesting reads. And some horrifying ones. This sub is ridiculous when claiming there's a gendered bias. I see way more ""iF tHe gEnDeRs wErE rEvErSeD!!!' comments than posts or comments that are even sympathetic towards women, let alone baselessly hostile towards men.


(Ex: people aren't calling a 16 y/o OP's dad bad because he's a man, but because he's denying his traumatized kid therapy. Not every criticism of a man in a relationship sub is misandry.)


Edit: y/o, not s/o It’s insane how quick people here are to say “divorce them, ditch them, they can’t be saved”. And for some reason just saying that, and NTA, gets you the top comment every time when in reality it’s shitty and lazy advice. Wasn’t like this a year or two ago  I love this Subreddit because it allows me to exercise my critical thinking skills; they are in desperate need of a work out sometimes. I’m also reminded (fairly regularly) of the person I do not want to be. Half the posts on this sub are wedding related I am so amazed at how often it becomes so apparent that people haven't bothered finishing reading even a relatively short comment or comment chain. It's kind of frustrating when someone goes 'well akshually' over something you've already covered, and I've seen some threads where it's clear that I'm not the only one who gets frustrated by this, lol. 

Slow down and read the whole conversation, people, or if you're going to reply to a subthread at least read a few comments up so you know the context! In the FAQ, there is this about attempting to ascertain whether a post is genuine:

>Sometimes, very real circumstances might seem absurd to you. When we judge whether or not a post is a creative writing exercise or a work of fiction, we don't ask ourselves ""is this likely to happen?"" We ask ourselves [""would Florida Man do it?""](https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2022/03/11/florida-man-calls-911-to-ask-if-deputies-can-test-if-his-meth-is-real/)Remember, people often post here on their worst day.

I propose this [article currently making the rounds](https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2022/03/11/florida-man-calls-911-to-ask-if-deputies-can-test-if-his-meth-is-real/) be perma-linked as I have done above. (To be clear, in the original FAQ, there is no link provided, to this current story, or otherwise.)

Discuss. I've never had a really close relationship with my family. Most of our encounters are diplomatic and are formalities. 
And HOLY CRAP has this subreddit really reaffirmed that I'm saving myself a lot of drama and heartache by having this sort of relationship. The number of people who deal with absolute emotional (and sometimes physical) carnage because ""they're family"" baffles me. Do any other users find their comments suppressed.? If find comments that are not going with the grain of the post are collapsed. I am not interested in the moderators explanations, I'd like to hear from other users. >YTA

>March madness happens every year, your sister-in-law probably only has another 2 or 3 weddings left in her.

This is the most brilliant and unique subversion of the YTA vote, and I am here for it. NTA, 

It seems to me like the toddler is using you for his personal gain and you are taking hits for him. Very toxic relationship. 


This was meant as a joke. Does anyone else notice that when the title sounds horrible and assholey, often the judgment is 'NTA' because the OP seems to already be good at reflecting, and when the title seems like OP did nothing wrong, they are usually TA? >  I was busy letting a toddler use me as a human shield in a fierce nerf gun battle with his brother. 

I'm reporting this for breaking Rule 5.  Considering how these brother-brother battles normally go, I'm quite sure that Rule 13 occurred too.  :) AITA for not wanting to fully support my wife's music career?
AITA for telling my husband to get a real job?

These are the same stories with the role reversed. You have different verdicts I'll trouble you with one more I haven't found an explanation for. Why are posts themselves deleted? Are posts just supposed to stay up only a couple of days until people get enough response and peace out? Are they being deleted by moderator? Or is the op throwing a hissy fit and deleting because reasons? Thank you. It's interesting that every teenager post I've seen is NTA (venting that they were screwed over and understandably needing assurance that they were treated unfairly). Have there been any cases where commenters agreed a teen was the A? Sometimes when a post gets popular, We get a 2nd post also, which shows the other POV. Happened recently with some college students, I think. Is there a way to flair such situations?
Those are some interesting reads. Thank you to mods for removing that post about the non-binary person being upset with their husband.  All the transphobia in that thread was honestly sickening.  And all the YTA votes as well. Does anyone here have genuine tips on how to be civil in this subreddit? I've been having a rather hard time lately because I swear some of these AHs are just.....not very good people at all. And when I get mad at something I uh...curse a lot. But I'm realizing this sub is supposed to be a lot more polite than that so.....yeah I need advice before I get banned LMAO I just wish everyone read Miss Manners, and understood that gifts should never be asked for, and there should be no quid pro quos when it comes to weddings, birthdays, or other personal celebrations.  

I follow the rule of not downvoting AHs, but it's really hard, since so many violate this rule as well as many other rules of polite behaviors. 

I'll say it again, read Miss Manners. Seriously. Q: Why do so many posters of popular threads here get their accounts suspended by Reddit admins? I’ve never seen this on any other sub. Did the monthly thread go back into contest mode after being edited? That's wild How the fuck has the helping my girlfriends bully thread not been locked yet. Surely dozens of genuinely disgusting and rule breaking comments there. Just watched [Sarah Z's most recent video](https://youtu.be/EeCi4CSqtzw) and I kinda feel like it should be required viewing here. Because it is definitely necessary on some threads. Anyone else notice that there seems to be a LOT fewer comment bots since the invasion started? 🤔 I don't know if it is just the enhancement suite I use or not, but I have noticed that if the comment starts with ESH, the comment/thread gets minimized for me. Not sure if this is on purpose to stop ESH comments from being down voted into oblivion. 

Just an interesting observation I have seen and I am wondering if anyone else has noticed as well. Does Reddit have any option to put a ""waiting period"" on a new account, that prevents posting until a certain time has passed (24 hours maybe?).

Throwaways are fine on this sub for obvious reasons, but a slight waiting period for a new account might cut down on trolls impulsively posting and posting. MODs:   AITA posts should only be made by members holding a daily active account for no less than 30 days. Please remove relationship, therapy and short fake story posts. Thank you. I'm new here (~1 week), but I think this sub is way too extreme and jumps to conclusions too fast. People call for divorce/ending a relationship if the SO does one bad thing. No real healthy relationship should be ended over one mistake. Forgive a (relative) newbie, but how are final judgements obtained?  Are they based on the judgement of the highest-voted comment, or....?

Thanks! what happened with the Aita awards? Did they ever get announced? I need to see updates on every post because some of these posts are so interesting and they never give an update on what happened after, we need a rule about that. When will we see the best of 2021 results? How do I search within AITA?
There's a newer post about bringing a child to a dog park to play with the dogs, and I believe about a week ago there was a post from the dog owner's POV. On an OP's original post, what is the difference between ""Removed"" and ""Deleted""? I just wanted to say thank you to the mods for helping me get unbanned from reddit (by linking me the appeal link). I didn't even know I was banned... How many commenters do you think actually read the ""why OP thinks they are TA"" part? I found a few instances when I'd be on a post that's been up for less than 10 hours and wrote a response but then come to find it's locked when I tried to submit my comment. The story is deleted and OP's page says they're suspended. What's going on there? Is it because they're engaging with others in an aggressive way? Vote manipulation? Fake stories? I'm just curious. Update on my struggles to remain civil in this subreddit. Just got a second warning today because I cursed out/insulted the perceived AH of a post. But honestly I'm started to feel a bit perplexed. I see actual examples of abusers and toxic folks here, but I'm expected to address them with respect/courtesy? Why? That's a genuine question. Its so sad when a post gets 1000+ comments within the first hour and I have no opinion on the story so cannot participate. :( I love how, in a discussion about the place of downvotes on this subreddit, the opinion that downvotes are overly misused and should have the option to be disabled is apparently off-topic or doesn't contribute to the discussion. Well done proving my point. Again, with the downvotes. Downvotes have Reddit-wide consequences. They also just *feel* shitty, so we don't want to participate. This tends to create a *hivemind*. You don't *need* to press that downvote button. You can simply just not upvote and scroll on. There is no *need* for this negativity. Why was thay post about tbe adopted brother removed for no interpersonal conflicts? Was the story a lie? I'm trying to make a post on an argument I had with someone but it said that the post was to META I don't know what to do? How do I post a story? Just curious as to why this sub thinks that parenthood is the END ALL BE ALL of life and should be taken more seriously than literally anything else. Like is it really ridiculous to expect a father who is a medical resident to drop everything and accept sleep deprivation ? Are people taking crazy pills or am i the problem here ? The term divorce is thrown around way to lightly here...

People who say this PLEASE STOP. OP wants to be judged, not told they deserve nothing in life and that they are worthless. 

Also, it's not as if OP divorcing someone would be an easy process. People can lose custody of their kids, ruin relationships, and give themselves more mental issues if they do.

So unless the person is in a horrible marriage, please don't suggest this.

Also, insulting someone shouldn't make them an asshole, unless it is telling someone to kill themselves or something along those lines, or a threat. 

Fatphobia isn't an issue here either, because yall are too sensitive. Telling someone to lose/gain weight because they have a health problem is 100% reasonable. I have a story,  but Idk how to post it. Country Can we make posts titled ""would I be the asshole if"" for cases where we want to consult Reddit on whether or not our actions are assholish before we actually do them? She & Him
I'm new here and the other day someone posted and asked if it was them or their adult child was being an AH for whatever reason. I glazed over that the OP said their child was a gender-neutral person, since it wasnt the main point of the post and ""gendered"" the person. I realized it later, as someone in the comments called me an AH and then I think, but not sure, that one of my comments was deleted. I glanced over the rules, but didn't see anything about this topic. 
But I also thought we weren't supposed to call others AH in the comments? 
So anyway, is this a rule? We can't ever use the default pronoun 'he'? Is reddit taking a political stance and ostracizing all non-conformers, and accidental utterances of such things? 
For the record, I don't care what gender someone is, just don't want to get banned from freely discussing who was the AH because grammar/gender issues and not understanding the rule. Was this just a rogue moderator and commenter getting petty? 
Should I have gone back and re-edited my post? 
I don't think I've seen the same thing from mixing up a daughter vs a son, I think it was specifically because I mixed up a (third?) Non binary gender and it was ASSumed I was being hateful when my mind had just glazed over something. 🙃
Thank you. Ok Guess this forum is only for cisgender marriage issues. Pregnancy posts and the like never get taken down unless they involve a trans man Is there a tag for AITA posts that are 50/50 judgement? I agree. Much less tedious are the ways people find to disagree with the blindingly obvious.

""My husband always attacks the disabled and steals their wheelchairs (or whatever aids they have) whilst laughing. I dont support this. AITA"".

Given about 500 replies, someone will reply with ""YTA. You are a team. You should have stood by him"" or something equally ridiculous.

Check the most downvoted posts. There is always at least one. Really? You don't think that someone who has convinced themselves of the false reality that their abuser had imposed upon them won't be helped by a slew of people explaining (in varying degrees of kindness) that no, it actually do not be like that? Chuckleheads will really be like ""If you say ___ then you are a bad person too!"" AITA for drinking 8 glasses of delicious Coca-Cola™ against my parents wishes? That's nothing new. I think one of the problems with reading this sub is that it affects your bullshit-o-meter. Mine is now so broken that I cant really comment on whether you are right or not.

That said, I often think that I could produce most of the posts I see with software. It's part of rule 7.

>Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts It may be a different post, but I saw one recently that was like, ""this incident happened several years ago, but then I ran into the person and part of the conflict group and they brought it up again and started texting me"" I think it was about a guy who had overcome some alcoholic use issues with an old friend Group.
Edit: does that count as not a current conflict? Well it helps if you look at it through the lens of 75% of stories being faked.  Happening one time?  I can picture it.  But then trolls see how popular those posts are and keep using that story template for fake outrage and stuff. I feel the same when I see like every other story about their phones being blown up by texts from the people the other party know. I know it definitely happens to some people, but I find it hard to believe when every story has it. On a lot of those threads, there is no real conflict between the actual parties involved. (Ex., I didn't eat my birthday cake at the party. [No one said anything about it.] Later my parents said I was rude.)

So OP throws in that some irrelevant people are ""blowing up their phone"" or complaining.  ---Which should be a violation of Rule 7, third parties weighing in don't count.

Mods mentioned earlier in this thread that they might consider adding ""What was the other party's response"" (or something similar) in the Summary Bot questions that an OP has to answer when posting; that might eliminate a lot of the threads when only other people are saying OP is an asshole. This was my exact thought reading the dog story that's at the top right now. Why does this exact situation happen in nearly every AITA post? I get really skeptical when I see those. >Does this really happen ?

I personally know a handful of friends that have experienced this.  Some are getting divorced (or already are) and this played a relevant part in that.  Another commonality in these cases seem to be men that expect their partner to fulfill much of the role their mother did that also go to their mother (or even MIL) to complain about the troubles in their marriage.  It's never a winning strategy, but man it happens too often.

That said, much like all wild and exciting posts on the front page, there's going to be plenty of people shitposting for whatever their motivation is here.  But there's not a topic that I haven't seen someone shitpost about. Oh yep, a recent example I can think of is when a woman dodnt want her husband in the delivery room, and multiple people said she must've cheated on him with a black man and she didnt want him to see the baby. Absurd. r/ breakingmom sucks that way, but I'm not sure it counts as harassment per se. They've never messaged me, and I regularly break their rule about not talking about them outside their sub as well as the one about commenting here, so I'm not sure why they singled you out. I also kinda feel hurt; apparently I'm not worthy of being told I'm not allowed to visit them. It’s not *entirely* normal, but yes there is a sub that uses a bot to ban anyone that comments here. You’d have to take it up with the admins whether that’s harassment, or your response to getting banned from a community you’ve never heard of qualifies as harassment. Generally speaking, “fuck off” could qualify, so personally I would have done with “I don’t give a fuck.” And someone said he was happy to see his mama. He wasn't even looking at her. Today we need to know if we are the asshole if an SO lets your pet snake go in the backyard… I don't think it's that uncommon. People might not say specifically ""will you apologize"" but they might angrily say that they expect an apology for how someone after or if they tell someone that they were hurt and the other person tries to brush it off, they might say something like ""what, you won't even apologize?"" So it's not necessarily happening really often, but it's happening enough IRL that I believe it. I have a theory that most redditors either have 

1. Incredibly low self esteem and self worth. 

2. No idea what a healthy relationship looks like (or what a positive relationship could be); or

3. Are just lonely and desperate. 

Because people here will literally be like “Stop telling people to break up over petty things!” And those “petty things” will be straight up toxic or abusive. 

Redditors: It’s better to be alone than settle. There are billions of people. You will find someone compatible. “Love” is not enough to make people compatible. I am pretty sure thats just reddit being reddit. And I don't really see what the mods can do about it... its the sub members upvoting stuff. There used to be a SHTPST option, though the mods decided to remove it. I do get it might be used too liberally, but the downside is that there are so many fake posts nowadays and talking about them here and other subs (if you still want to participate here) is forbidden. There is. It's called the shitpost report. You would need too many variants for this to be practical, I suspect.

Personally, I would get more use out of ""WHO CARES"" and ""\*\*\*\* OFF"". Actually a whole bunch of obscenities would be appropriate from time to time. People usually just call it out in the comments. You know the fact that your so concerned with ""people being accused of being abusive without proper 'evidence'"" kind of makes me think your an abusive asshole and should be arrested.  


/s I liked the one where a woman didn't want her husband in the delivery room while she was giving birth, only her female relatives, and a bunch of people jumped to the conclusion that she must be having an affair with a man of a different race Lol yeah. though that is an internet thing, people just love making things seem more ' interesting' here. I've said it before but I'll say it again:

You can maybe convince me that one person is an evil crazy baby stealer. You cannot convince me that multiple other people also agree with them. I'm guessing half are people being reminded of something similar that happened to them, and half are fakes cashing in on the trend. It's for when OP deletes their post before 48 hours (rule 4). You can report any of OP's comments or the bot copy of a post. But it does get used to alert us when an OP rage quits. I normally consider that saying it was just a ""prank"" is just a weak attempt at justification.  Saying its a ""prank"" is not a license to do anything you want. I don't believe any of those. Even the milder ones would in real life have everyone the prankster knows coming down on them like a ton of bricks (or they would be prevented altogether from even doing it). That's the fate of subs that grow too big. When the sub was much smaller it was better. Now there a lot of over the top (poorly written) creative writing and comments that repeat the same worn out reddit jokes.

There are more realistic posts. Problem is, no upvotes them because they are too mundane If all you read is the front page, that is indeed what 99% of posts are.

If you want to see the really tricky ones, you need to search by new or controversial. Check out r/ AITAfiltered for a more equal mix. My philosophy is to give the benefit of the doubt, just because sometimes assholes are stranger than fiction. If it's really out there, I just downvote and maybe report it as a shitpost so the mods can sort it out. I was about to comment the same thing. It's getting out of hand. The post is always ""AITA for being mad at autistic person for doing horrible thing?"" and the comments are all ""NTA!!! Autism is no excuse for this behaviour!!!"" Please report these under rule 12, and [ping us in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you think it's more nuanced than a report can accommodate. 

I'd love a world where we can nest reports such that you can say ""this breaks rule whatever"" and we give you a few options of how, specifically, it breaks it. That's not how reddit works. 

Sucks Techie got downvoted because we literally rewrote this rule for exactly this kind of issue. We're not okay with it. We're just not perfect at it, and at our size, regularly have new mods on the scene. Exactly! And it makes people who have actually been hurt by someone on the  autism spectrum look bad. It also makes people who do have autism look bad aswell. I've been harassed and sa'd by someone on the spectrum, but I alsp have multiple friends who are on the spectrum, and I know no 2 autistic people are alike, but others here might get a bad impression, and people who do have actual issues and aren't making abliest bait will sadly get mistaken for the autism bad troll posts. [Here's the post where we talk about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mis7n4/meta_rule_12_adjustments_and_new_lgbtqia_resource/).  Rule 12 in this context applies the same to all marginalized groups so report them as noted in that post and we will act accordingly. What are you talking about? Children stop developing at age 2 mentally and need constant supervision until they turn 14, at which point a switch flips that makes them full adults and you can call them an AH for making mistakes. /s just in case Hey now, lazy trolls are easier to catch! yeah, like ""Someone did an asshole thing, so I did an asshole thing right back"" is the definition of ESH. Especially when it's in the context of conflicts within relationships. It's like, congratulations, you got in a sick burn on your controlling MIL. You did nothing to repair the relationship or remove yourself from an unhealthy situation, and you may have worsened other relationships in your life -- but she sucks worse, so don't worry! NTA!

Too many people focused on not being *the* asshole when they're definitely being *an* asshole. I agree. 

I think the whole revenge / schadenfreude / witch-hunt thing is one of the things that makes this sub so popular though. I like to find a way to vote NAH Literally it’s so suspicious. I remember there was a period about three months ago where every other post for two days started with “sorry for my bad language” and were about being forced to take care of younger siblings. All written the same way. There’s some aspiring authors here. Omg I just read the blues one. Lolol. Curious if its true. I think it may be. My pet peeve is the people who go 'NTA but ____ is'. Like, yes. Yes, that would be what 'NTA' means. Otherwise you'd be using NAH. :| >Can we report them for not knowing ESH exists?

This falls firmly under ""sort it out with votes"" territory.

The alternative would be us arbitrarily deciding if they used the vote wrong, and we would make *a lot* of wrong calls where people actually think someone is or isn't the asshole for reasons that seem crazy to us. I sometimes write replies to people who don't seem to understand the voting. Usually about the vote bot grammar though, eg only putting one of the four judgements in, not emphasising it by putting spaces in between, etc. Absolutely, I looked at the other day and saw, ovaries, fallopian tubes and a uterus, I though I was alone! I’m so glad I am not the only one! There is SO MUCH outrage bait on this sub. Just posts that exist to get people furious about a black-and-white situation, instead of genuinely seeking feedback on their behaviour. Mods should be way more active against these posts. I get that they're popular and drive tons of traffic to the sub, but they detract from the purpose of the sub. Also, it could be argued that those posts are immoral, as they only seek to cause people to feel negative emotions. Sh... just smile and nod and... something something broken normal meter.... >This sub wasn't always like this

Are you sure you aren't looking at the past of the sub through rose colored glasses?  There are meta posts 3+ years old from when the sub had a few hundred thousand members of people making the exact same commentary.  Hell, 6 years back is the first instance I could find of someone begging for more assholes and the sub didn't even have 10,000 people then. The tone and intensity of the backlash is what they are not prepared for. They're expecting to be dumped by a wave, and it turns out to be a tsunami. On the reddit mobile app (Android), if you go to your history and then select hidden, you can see them https://www.reddit.com/user/CutlassKitty/hidden/

This is where I go on PC (on old) to see the posts I've hidden.  I'm not sure how it looks on mobile or how to get there.  But from old on a PC you just click your username and you have a handful of tabs at the top to sort through (including saved and hidden).

I similarly accidentally hit it all of the time.  20 times in the past five months apparently which isn't as bad as usual. Absolutely!   Although I guess that’s too be expected…. 

A month or so ago we had a fun post that violated north of 6 rules and we didn’t bother counting past that.  So often I find myself debating the question of “do I select all 4 rules they broke for the macro, or do I just select the most egregious because I think they’ll nitpick about a nuance of rule 12 while ignoring all of the other clear issues”. It sends a PM that asks 1)What action did you take in the conflict? 2)Why do you think you that action might make you the asshole?

So pretty close. We don't explicitly ask ""What was the other party's response?"" but we always look for it in the post when it's been reported for rule 7. I like this idea. I've thought before that there should be a pop-up or something that requires the OP to verify that their post doesn't break rules 5 or 11, but I don't think that's technically feasible, especially with pop-up blockers being so ubiquitous. I think the only thing I'd add on this one is a question asking why the OP thinks they're not the asshole. It does seem unlikely that an OP would vociferously reject being called the good guy in a conflict.

... I wonder if it's happened. People loooooove to say it’s about the health of the person but they don’t give a fuck if people drink too much, smoke, do drugs, or any else  harmful to your health-it’s literally just because they don’t like to look at fat people and don’t want to admit what a shitty person that makes them. The ignorance on display is sometimes so extreme that its almost amusing.

""Have you ever tried NOT being fat?"" People on AITA are so fatphobic, it’s horrific. It doesn’t occur to them that most fat people are AWARE THEY'RE FAT. 

Also, even if someone is unhealthy….it’s their body and it’s not up to you to force them to be better. Do people who harass fat folks also knock cigarettes out of peoples hands? Are they in perfect health, or is it just different if they’re skinny? Especially when being thin does not equal being healthy. It really is mind blowing. There is an awful lot of the extreme “fat acceptance” around here though too. I was called fatphobic for assuming that someone who was described as 100 LBs overweight and continually eating massive amounts of junk food was probably unhealthy. And informed that BMI is completely meaningless because Serena Williams is technically overweight. Yeah.... I've seen a couple 14 year Olds get bullied hard in the comments and it just upsets me so much. On desktop, sort by old.  On mobile, sort by new, then replace ""new"" with ""old"" in the address.  Either way, the comment is on top, and you can even get the permalink directly to the comment itself if you like.  No idea if the app lets you put the original on top. As I understand it, there's a short answer and a long answer. Short answer is ""no.""

The long answer is that the mods can only pin 1 comment on a post, and that's currently the ""why I might be TA"" comment. To pin the post copy would require that to be unpinned and the post copy to be pinned. Automod can't do this, so it would be a manual mod action on every removed post, regardless of how it was removed. As the mods' workload is somewhere between ""pretty fucking busy""  and ""moderating haunts my dreams please God make it stop,"" that's not a palatable option. And since most apps and the desktop site allow you to sort comments by old and have the post copy pop up on top (iOS app being the primary exception, I believe), it's a lot of work for relatively little gain. Also, while it may be a single event that is being explained in the post... typically speaking, there's always a pattern of behavior, or that event hints at some fundamental aspect of that persons personality that shows they are simply incompatible. You're absolutely right about this tho. And they will also say the op is TA for not doing one of those sooner with no other judgment than that If that explanation were true, people wouldn't complain about it.  They complain because voters *are* too trigger-happy with those various forms of separation.  More importantly, if we're really trying to reach the OPs, a short message urging them to do that likely won't influence them.  People want these beaten-down OPs to fly before they even learn to walk.  Asking them to *consider* separation as a possible future action if things get/stay bad would be far more likely to influence the OPs.  The only thing ""get out"" accomplishes is to give readers a dopamine hit for pressing ""up-vote."" I've been reading this page for about a week and joined for about a day, I think it's because people in ""normal"" relationship have never seen the ""abusive"" relationship characteristic, and they want to protect the OP who they feel isn't realizing their partner is an AH. Because they wouldn't put up with it, OP shouldn't have to either. But to be fair a lot of the posts I've seen were about financial abuse and stuff like that. The one op had her unemployed partner ""borrow"" her debit card whilst she was sleeping. So in this case I think the chorus of ""dump him! Drop that zero and get you a hero!"" Is a natural reaction because everyone is thinking it. Yes, sometimes I actually *want* the couple in the post to break up because they sound like they *despise* each other I think a lot of people in the world just don’t understand how addiction is a disease. Of course no one is obligated to sacrifice their own well-being in service of someone else, but a little empathy for those battling with addiction would go a long way. 

This isn’t just a problem on AITA though, it’s a problem throughout society, partially because addicts are most often demonised by the media and govt. It’s unreal the lack of knowledge that goes into these comments saying “divorce them, ditch them, they can’t be saved” etc.  I’m debating leaving this sub for good bc people give shit advice like that instead of diving into the nuances >""well, being a parent is a 24/7 job and the one who works outside the home is getting a break and when does the other parent get a break?

Seen a lot of this, especially in the YTA vein where the person working is knocking out ridonculous hours but is still an AH because they're not doing all the household chores as well.

Worked on a project where a couple of site workers were doing 12-14hr shifts.  They drive back after a shift, dude falls asleep at the wheel, crashes the car and both sadly die.  It's a true story but that won't shake the AITA melange from calling them AHs because ""you have a kid, what do you expect.""  It's rage inducing seeing real life consequences for this kind of situation yet the reddit massive just casts it off and downvotes if it's dared to be pointed out.

""Well what do you expect, you've got a kid?""  Well I expect that we live in a world where nobody has to die because they're so exhausted from living the AITA ""non-asshole"" life that they're so shattered to the point that they crash into the central reservation and kill themselves and their passenger.

This sort of stuff really brings me to the edge of a rule 1 breach when I see it.... and I'd breach the rule #1 if it wasn't there because I see so many dangerous responses to real world situations that shouldn't be allowed to stand. And the real reason why you were banned from r/ breakingmom is revealed...

You monster.

In all seriousness, you are right. I have looked after kids of various ages for months at a time. The idea that you never ever get a break 24/7 is nonsense.

Is it harder than a day job? Not really comparable. Certainly not easy to compare.

Then again, like everything in here, few people let facts - or even the blindingly obvious - get in the way of their hyperbole As a stay at home parent I agree.  So many people miss the nuance involved here.

My explanation is always that 40 hours a week of stay at home parenting is easier than most jobs I've had in my life.  But when my wife is away or working a stretch of 12's and I'm doing everything for 96 or 168 hours straight it's the hardest job I've ever had.

I do most of the household chores and upkeep, because that's the reasonable balance for us.  But I only have the energy to do that when the parenting time while my spouse isn't working is equitably split.  So often in these situations the parenting responsibilities when the other parent is home aren't equitably split and that seems to be the heart of the issue.  The uneven distribution of the mental load is such a common factor too.

But because those issues aren't always explicitly talked about and everyone comes in with their expectations of what the situation likely is it gets messy and that nuance is missed. Not sure why that thread wasn't removed for the ""revenge"" rule. Yea that is...that's a post that I'm not sure why isn't considered a revenge post to be honest with you. Deliberate actions done to hurt someone seems like it'd fall in that category. Wow, the responses in that thread are fucking wild.  Just wow… Yeah that post made me feel weird. On one hand, I fucking loathe cheaters and how they get to have happy ever Afters sometimes. But on the other, what the op did to their mom still just didn't sit right with me. Felt bad and just couldn't give any judgement. That's how this sub has been since I joined when there were like 30K subscribers and a ""hot"" post got 100 upvotes.

If people were, on average, able to recognize when a situation is toxic, just how toxic it is, and/or how to reconcile the impact of that situation, therapists would be in the unemployment line overnight. Humans are messy.

I will say, the voting patterns changed as we got big. As we grew, ""assholes"" got punished with votes, ""good people"" got rewarded with thousands of upvotes. A lot of Redditors are 

1.young and/or emotionally immature


2 incapable of original thought and post the same worn-out joke or sayings for easy karma Wow it took me a long time to work out what on earth you meant. Lack of coffee.

Regardless of 'old' its boring and witless. Yawn. It's a reoccurring trend. They pop up every so often. its a 'one post of this type got on the top, proffesional AITA fakers will now write this type' effect IMO. Modding posts can be super tricky. We try to get things right the first time but it doesn’t always happen. The good thing is that if an OP feels the post removal wasn’t warranted they can reach out to us and, if appropriate, we’ll put the post back up for them.

One thing to note specifically regarding R5 is that sometimes the OP will include rule breaking content in their comments rather than the main post. Depending on what was said/whether they were flagged by automod or reported by a user, you might never see the comments that prompted the removal. Thanks to our extensive moderation guidelines and firm stance against violence mentions in particular, manual R5 removals are rarely misfires, though I appreciate that they can sometimes feel a bit random when you can’t see what we can from our side. Nope, no mod drama but we did have a handful of new mods that just started around that time.  Modding posts is hard and there’s definitely a learning curve.

The total and complete lack of drama behind the scenes is absolutely fantastic too.  I hear so many horror stories that make me appreciate the team we have. Easy karma lol Seriously. At some point you have to realize that the other person has done everything they can do and that it's going to suck for a while. It's a really crappy situation, but from what OP said they did what they could to mitigate the noise and when you make the choice to have a baby you don't know you're getting the loud colicky one. Came here to say this. I also see outright YTA judgments, which people seem to feel very justified giving mothers who have come for judgments on parenting or pregnancy related issues because their partner is undermining their sense of reality.

It's not how judgments are supposed to be used and it is harmful to someone in a really vulnerable situation. Can we have a PSA about this? Is there a rules violation mods agree this falls under that we can report these as? You cannot just say something like this and not explain further. The what??? Looks like the admins shadowbanned you.  Here's the macro we use in modmail explaining it:

---

Your account appears to be shadowbanned. This is a ban issued by the reddit site-wide admins that deletes all your comments and posts without notice (you see them in your profile - no one else can see them). ***The AITA mods have nothing to do with this ban and cannot assist in resolving.***

In order to resolve this, you will need to contact the admins. Please contact them here: https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request A message to modmail is best.  If you're just looking to report ""no violence"" is going to be how we connect the dots. Came here seeing if I could find them 👀 😅 Stuff like that always makes me think that backstories shouldn't be allowed. We get it, the other person was terrible to OP; expounding on what exactly they did over the years borders on not explaining the conflict fairly. Given how many of them end up NTA when it should probably be ESH (because yes, they were definitely assholes, but now the OP has sunk to their level), I'm starting to wonder if it doesn't actually cross the line. It's too bad Reddit functionality is not sophisticated enough to set a ""max"" downvote on a single comment. 

Dissenters might be willing to endure 50 or even 100 downvotes in order to offer an alternate perspective on a conflict, if the bleeding got stopped at that point. Rhetorical question: is it still a Rule 3 violation if the comments in question are comically over-the-top venting? Follow-up question: is the finger on the Big Red Button just a lil’ slower when the Rule 3 violations are SUPER funny? That one deserves to be saved for next year's awards. Sadly we can only have one pinned comment per post and that prime real estate has been snatched up by the OP’s judgement bot answer. Easiest way to view the original text is to sort comments by old, which is possible on the regular Reddit website and all mobile apps other than the official Reddit iOS app. As someone who uses the official Reddit iOS app, I understand if this answer is very underwhelming, but sorting by old is the best thing we’ve got at the moment. I’d agree with this.

If OP specifies an age under 18, I try and treat them with kid gloves. And in fairness, a lot of other commenters do. 

But some don’t and the responses there are often more damaging than helpful. People talk to a 15 year old like they would a 40 year old. And teenagers aren’t as resilient to the brutal criticism. >nuance

Saying *anything* neutral (or, heaven forbid, positive) about the behaviour of a person deemed to be 'the asshole' is karma suicide lol

""She shouldn't have cheated but I don't really think her making bead bracelets in her spare time is wrong in any way"" (-852) yeah this's a sub that attracts assholes, both posting and commenting Yes, when I get downvoted and dogpiled on for going against the grain, the lack of empathy and nuance is palpable. People sometimes accidentally check/click nsfw or spoiler when posting. We remove it when we see it. That's a good one for next month! I mean, shitpost is the report option, but a lot of repeats are simply that certain issues regularly stir up drama. Not every kid posting about their teacher or step mom is Betty. Not every post about pads and tampons is the period troll. 

Feel free to report them, but we don't pull posts as shitposts if we don't have a substantial reason to believe they're fake. I dont like contest mode for the simple reason that you cant list posts in chronological order. If you mean you would like the votes suppressed, then I agree.

As things stand though, contest mode makes a thread impractical to navigate and I do like to check back on certain posts. I feel like a lot of times OP says “storming out” or “blew up” to avoid the dialogue that was actually said, probably because it would make them look like an asshole. Thank you. I will now be using the phrase ""Tears sprang to my lashes"" whenever possible. One of the things that happens in any community is that language evolves because we as humans reflect the way others communicate. It’s why code switching occurs and can be unconscious; most of us use different slang, syntax etc with different audiences. AITA is no exception. I used to think ‘I lashed out at them’ was a troll indicator, because I’ve never heard that phrase in real life ever, but I’ve come to realise that sometimes, it’s just that a poster has read that phrase a lot and on some level has absorbed the idea that it’s the right way to communicate ‘I got mad’.

People storming off, lashing out or blowing up phones are just all part of AITA language now. My family uses stormed out a decent amount. 'Become' you say? Hasnt changed that much since Ive been posting here which admittedly isnt that long. But then, I feel that is more systemic to reddit than an issue with the sub itself. The whole thing is a giant pecking party. 

I suppose the explicit invitation to judge cant help though. In terms of shots landed? Older brother. In terms of fun had? Younger brother and me. Older one was in a *mood.* That is a very interesting idea.  There is no way we could police it or make it consistent, but I’d like to see that discussion. Info: What day of the week did this occur, OP?

OP: It was a Tuesday.

Redditors: Let's all downvote this completely polite, informative, innocuous response. This sub is so toxic in that way. I'm so sick of being downvoted for having an unorthodox opinion, going against the hive mind. Regarding that one, I feel it was clearly a fake post. Took a look into his profile and the only other thing he has posted is a thread about Miraculous spoilers. 

I don't know, it feels odd that a man with a college-aged son spends time in miraculous forums. It might be the case, but it might also be a bored 20-something making stuff up for karma. It's a report, not a vote. Rule 8 You can report the post. I swear I've seen the same person posting a bunch who writes the titles in full caps every single time, and it annoys me so much lol The rule isn't just about relationships, but also sexual autonomy. I didn't read that post when I saw it earlier, but if it had anything to do with sex or sexual autonomy, it probably fell under the rule.

The mods have also said that they'll occasional remove shitposts for non-shitpost rules that  apply because there's less arguing for those rules. There's a known period troll; I wouldn't be surprised if the mods knew this one was a shitpost and removed it for a different rule.

I've spend quite a lot of time talking to mods about the rules and why they remove posts, and I really haven't seen them removing posts just for the fun of it. At a tangent to what your issue, but I have noticed something i find mysterious for a while.

A post that is kinda outrageous and yet very believable gets locked after an hour max for rule 8: No shitposts.

Now if it is a shitpost, then they fooled me and I am incredibly cynical.  Also, I dont care whether posts are shitposts tbh.

Another oddity is that, with all of these posts, it is clear early on that it will get locked anyway for the quantity of rulebreaking, so its not like it makes any difference.

I used to think the mods just think 'fuck this - i cant be assed to deal with it. Ill use rule 8 cos why not'. I now suspect its as simple as the mods are detecting some kind of tell in these posts that I am not privy to.

Im not explaining this very well. There is a commonality to the posts I am referring to. I suppose I should start keeping the text of such posts to see if I can spot whatever it is. Worried that he won't be the only Meta at kinda? It shows as [Removed by Reddit] so it was probably a ban evader the admin bots picked up and removed. On California you can just claim someone to be the father and unless they get a DNA test in 24 (might be 48 or 72) hours, they are legally the father. I downvote when the response/judgment is unrelated to the question posed.

Example: AITA for not letting my brother live rent free in my rental property?

Response: YTA because you own a rental property. I downvote anyone who writes ""THIS!!!"" as a response.

And anyone who misuses the blood is thicker quote of course. I’ll also downvote stuff that I think has the potential to cause active harm, which sometimes falls under just plain wrong but not always. I downvote comments that leave a judgement with no explanation. mainly I downvote comments that are just a judgement with absolutely no explanation or justification. also blatant bigotry, right before reporting them I rarely if ever downvote. 

The only ones I do are the abusive OPs saying what they are doing is ok or hate speech like ' bi people don't exist' or 'men are better cause [insert bad argument]' I watched a guy get downvoted into oblivion for explaining why he preferred living in a neighborhood with an HOA. I think anything where suggestions etc geninely have a potential to cause harm/are causing harm.  Things like bigotry are generally reportable but some thing don't fit quite cleanly into a report category but are just... for want of a better term, very bad.  JAQing off is a good way for someone to hide their bigotry as ""just asking questions.""

Also ageism, because it's almost always off topic and it's fecking rampant in this sub.  Anything from age gaps in relationships (even small ones) to ""oh they're not 25, their brain hasn't fully developed yet.""  Essentially, it's still a form of bigotry. I don't like downvotes. At all. The only things I downvote are when my finger accidentally hits the button as I'm scrolling on mobile, and I remove that as soon as I realize it. I figure that under the rules of this sub, it should probably be removed it I would downvote it. AITA is odd in that there are very.... reoccurring villains which can make it seem like there is a gender bias.

For every lazy man child (hoping I can say this here even tho its banned in comments!) Theres an evil infertile SIL. For every cheating husband theres a crazy MIL. I must say I have never noticed much gendered bias. But that could be me being dumb rather than it not being there. 

Anyway, my point is that I am always mildly surprised by the frequency of 'if the genders were reversed' comments. Theres absolutely a clear gender bias here and regarding the dad not letting his son get therapy the OP mentioned that the father was a abused by a psychologist when he was young.

It's important to remember were getting a small glimpse of the whole picture from each post. I agree with most of your comment but I've been on Reddit for over 10 years and it's *always* been like this on any advice/relationship subreddit - I don't think AITA is any different. In fact one of the top all-time posts, from almost exactly 3 years ago, has the title ""Too many AITA commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth"". 

It's definitely a problem though. People can be very quick to jump to conclusions from a one-sided story that presents a limited glimpse of a relationship. It started when the mods enacted the ""you have to pretend every post is totally real"" rule, which then paved the way for thousands of validation posts and cartoon villain posts, which makes people think in black in white, which THEN makes people think that way for every single post here. I agree! It wasn't like this a year ago at least min. ""Oh I forgot to take out the trash"" immediately must break-up/divorce!

Seriously people, ever heard of talking it out or Couple's Counseling? Going nuclear is not the only and must resort to option. >I love this Subreddit because it allows me to exercise my critical thinking skills; they are in desperate need of a work out sometimes. I’m

Really? Because critical thinking isn't something that gets used a lot here. The popular topics seem to come and go in cycles.

It might be useful to schedule these in beforehand, so we can prepare some amusing comments in advance:

Eating Disorder Tuesday.

Bizarre Cultural Appropriation Day.

Anaphylaxis Friday.

Mother In Law Month Some of the threads here are incredibly long. I get what you're saying, and folks should totally finish reading the OP post, but I think it's unrealistic to believe anyone would or should read every single comment in the thread. The most interesting daily posts get turned into tiktok vids… I know cause my daughter listens to them every evening so I get to re-listen to all the posts I read throughout the day. More and more posts are posted simply for the tiktok views later on, its kinda sad really cause they all fake. Why not just quote the whole article in the rules? Nobody could be bothered clicking on links, especially after going to all the effort of reading the rules. I think they copied and pasted from an old resource or something without updating it to reflect the change in how the rule is reported. It could just be Reddit's ""crowd control"" feature. Usually its if the comments have downvotes in negative. Under Preferences--->Comment Options there is a choice about hiding comments with a score less than some number you designate. Classic toddler. Always gaslighting others. 🚩🚩🚩 When I see a title that is like ""AITA for wearing clothes"" or ""AITA for eating pizza"", where there's no way the op actually believes that the activity in question is problematic, I tend to think ""If you have to phrase it that way to justify yourself, you probably are"". 
Either that, or possibly clickbait. Nobody genuinely thinks that the act of doing a boring everyday thing makes you a bad guy. That's called clickbait. Or that in an unanimous YTA post, the OP has totally missed the point about what the problem was? Yes, I think so. I think there's a few things that cause this effect. First is that a lot of assholes really aren't good at reflecting on their actions. If they were, they wouldn't be assholes. They might try to play down some of it to varying degrees, but overall if they think they did nothing wrong they'll gladly tell you what they did without a hint of dissembling. And they'll use a title that reflects their thinking, which is often much milder than their actions.

I also think a good number of unrepentant YTA posts, particularly the ones where OP never responds, might be written by the other person in the conflict. I have no proof, but there's too many posts where the OP could offer up an explanation for something that would mitigate their assholery and they never do. It seems like someone else wrote it so they could prove they were right and they don't care that much about the truth.

Then there's people who get voted NTA and they use the other person's accusation as their title. ""AITA for stealing my nephew? I got permission from my brother to take my nephew to a theme park while i was babysitting him and my SIL got off work early and came to pick him up but I wasn't there and my brother can't have his phone at work. We had fun but SIL is mad I took him without her permission and said I stole him."" The title is bad but it's what the OP is accused of so that's what they use.

Finally there's the ones where the OP is probably an unreliable narrator but it's just even-handed enough that it's not really reportable. Somehow OP keeps their cool and answers calmly while the other person storms away and blows up their phone. Those I suspect might be a bit clickbaity to draw in votes and views. I think the revenge will rain upon me for being the asshole friend who shows up to rile the kids up before bed. Did the same exact people comment on both posts? You can have almost identical stories (with no reversal) posted a week or two apart and get different verdicts. The verdicts of people who post early get a lot of weight. For some reason lol Difference is in the first one its the wife’s non-paying career, in the second it’s the wife complaining about her husbands non-paying career. Both posts are aligned in that the wife is NTA, as you would expect from this sub seeing as 75%+ are women commenting. >Are posts just supposed to stay up only a couple of days until people get enough response and peace out? Are they being deleted by moderator? Or is the op throwing a hissy fit and deleting because reasons?

All of the above.

In most cases, if a post has been flaired we don't touch it unless it's egregious. At that point, the ""damage"" is already done, the discussion has died down, and the only thing we're accomplishing is shutting down the few lingering convos.

If it's before 18 hours, if it's us 9/10 there's a stickied comment from us explaining the removal. The 1/10 is if we think we'll need to engage them directly in modmail for various reasons.

*A lot* of people dirty delete. We definitely don't catch all of them, but that's what rule 4 is for. Yes, however, as an adult I prefer not to comment on teenager posts. I don't know if anyone else feels the same way. Lol so many.

Some kid was upset this weekend because his mom watches Netflix at a loud volume next to where he ""needs"" to play PS 5 hours a day. We get at least one of those types of posts a week. They just usually don't hit the front page. Omg yes lol I'm yet to see one that doesn't seem incredibly fake. In general, when the other party just ""appears"" somehow, I assume it's someone taking advantage of the popular post for karma. I was seriously disturbed by some of the comments there. Even saw a comment that said Op was ""gaslighting"" their husband by... not coming out as NB until they themselves had accepted that they were? I see the term gaslighting misused a lot on reddit, but this was the most outrageous use of it. The sheer amount of people unwilling to learn the least bit about non-binary identities was extremely painful. ""Pick your fights"" would be my advice. Swearing is fine. Uncivil means attacking/insulting people. So ""NTA, that's fucked up and you shouldn't be in that fucking position, but that's the other person's fucking fault"" is fine while ""NTA, they're a loser"" is not. Similarly ""YTA, that's really childish behavior"" is okay while ""YTA, you are such a child"" is not.

If someone really upsets you and you need a good way to share tell them, my preference is ""you're not living up to the person Mr. Rogers knew you could be."" It's not really insulting but it is shaming. It helps to remember the likelihood of this being a real situation is very low. Many of the situations are very likely creative writing meant to get a strong reaction out of people. Not at all familiar is Miss Manners, but one of the most interesting books i have ever read is an etiquette guide from the late 1800s.

Some of it (well a lot of it) is bizarre. If a gentleman is walking with a lady along a road, then he is obliged to walk on the left hand side. That is the only way to keep the sword arm free and simultaneously shield said lady from unfortunate splashes from the road. When I was a kid my grandparents got my brother a simplified “Tiffany’s table manners” book that I feel like was from the fifties.  That was a weird read but there’s two things that stuck out as surprising:

When out to eat you specifically shouldn’t wait for everyone to be served.  Instead as long as at least one other person is served you can start so you’re not all letting your food get cold.  As long as you aren’t eating alone it’s good.  Same with a causal dinner party at someone’s house.  It’s only specifically at formal dinner party you wait for everyone to be served.

Asparagus is a finger food if you want. Eh, Miss Manners is a bit hit or miss, as well. Not to mention that what goes against etiquette does not always also go against social norms. 
I do agree that gifts should never be demanded, but I don't think Miss Manners is the greatest source to convince anyone who doesn't already read her. I think it's the nature of this sub that it attracts a lot of trolls creating fake stories (either trying to stir up outrage/hatred against a particular group, or scamming by soliciting donations through PMs, or writing fiction to use in a clickbait article).

Of all the posts on the subreddit, I'm sure the majority are genuine. But it makes sense that you'd find a disproportionate number of trolls among the most-upvoted posts because the stories were specifically designed to be compelling and outrageous, and that's what gets a lot of comments and upvotes. Pretty much all of them are banned by the admins for ban evasion.

From what we've been told one of the tools the admins use to catch ban evasion is automated and catches someone quicker the more times we ban them. I was going to post the same question. I wondered if anyone else had asked the same thing - but thats difficult in contest mode.

I only found your post by searching for 'contest' lol.

Im very curious why. Its very mysterious! Did you report the rule breaking comments? I'm gonna quote one of the comments because it perfectly describes a massive problem with this sub and social media in general:

""The pathologizing language is the worst part imo. Everyone I dislike is a narcissistic, abusive, gaslighting sociopath. No such thing as assholes, disagreements, or honest mistakes: the only person acting in good faith is me."" 

More specifically that last sentence is really eye opening. We're all guilty of it at times but due to the nature of this sub it's a really prevalent and dangerous mentality here. It's like that classic road mentality of ""everyone slower than me is an idiot and everyone faster than me is a dangerous lunatic"". Like your mistakes are mistakes but other people's mistakes are a calculated effort to hurt you and make your life terrible. Interesting. Not much new to me in there tbh. I can its relevance. You can see all of that being played out in here over and over. Its predictable to the point of being tiresome.

If you found that interesting, ""So You've Been Publicly Shamed"" by Jon Ronson covers much of the same ground from another angle. Not his most readable book but worth a read, as they all are.

After the first 5-10 mins of the video I was considering thanking you for pointing me in the direction of such solid dating tips lol It's such a shame she's a hypocrite since she did the same thing. Oh how I wish that was my experience. I feel like this is kinda unnecessary When COVID was in full swing people used to spam ""YTA for doing X because pAnDeMiC!!!"" whenever a post was about a conflict that happened in public, even if it was at a grocery store or something. > ""YTA because of some other thing I found on your Reddit profile that's unrelated to your post but I find it disagreeable."" 

There's no way this isn't a rule 1 violation. ""AITA for filing a lawsuit that forced a company to stop destroying the environment all willy-nilly, thus forcing the CEO to take a job as a WalMart greeter?""

""Of course YTA. You're a lawyer and you mentioned WalMart."" Do you think the same trolls that repeatedly create accounts and evade bans would be deterred by needing to create those accounts 24 hours in advance and sitting on them?

We do have the option to add whatever account age requirement we want.  But from my experience repeatedly banning these trolls any account, karma, or email limit will barely even slow the trolls down and will always be a larger negative impact on the real people that post here. You're posting this request from a 2 day old account.  Do you see the issue there? ...so you want the mods to continue removing 2 types of posts that are already against the rules and add in ""therapy"" posts, whatever that means? Your last sentence is why it doesn't bother me too much that people call for divorce so easily. If a relationship is healthy and the OP's post is about the only real issue, it's very unlikely to crash and burn because a bunch of internet strangers said to end it. And if the relationship ends on our say-so, it wasn't that strong or healthy. It's like writing ""Do a barrel roll"" on your roof; the jet pilots who do one didn't really need your encouragement. This is why we encourage all OPs to take all judgements with a pinch of salt and decide for themselves what makes sense in their circumstances. For some people, posting here is like a reality check and they realize for the first time after talking it out with internet strangers that maybe it’s not just one issue in an otherwise healthy relationship but actually part of a bigger, more distressing pattern that they didn’t see before. For others, there’s a lot of projection involved in the comments, and I just hope the OPs get a good laugh or two out of the experience (even if they are the asshole in the scenario) as they go through the comment section.

Everyone has their own limits and their own ideas of acceptable vs unacceptable behaviour from a partner. What one person might be able to work through could be the only reason someone else needs to instantly break up with their partner. At the end of the day only OP knows which response works for them. You're right, the bot checks the highest voted comment after 18 hours and tags the post with whatever judgement it has :) I am starting it now and should have it finished tonight. If you want posts with updates, either look at Asshole Archives->Updates or r/BestofRedditorUpdates

Such a rule would be arbitrary and unenforceable Aside from the impossibility of enforcing it. A lot of these posts are questionable from the beginning and the updates push it into that happened territory. Thanks for the feedback/rant!  I hear you on all of these too, that last one really hits home how poorly some users seem to understand the purpose of this subreddit too.  The very specific reason we have this sub is to allow people to basically poll how others feel on the morality of the situation presented.  To expect that people conform to your standards and change their behavior based on that is missing the point entirely.  You're the one that's living with the consequences of your choices, all we can (and should) do is provide the perspective you asked for and offer anything else of value we think we can and let you do with that what you will. >Sometimes being the asshole is still the best option in certain situations.

I agree. It sometimes feels like I live in a different world to some of the people in here.

'YTA for responding in kind when faced with open hostility'. 

'YTA for using foul language in response to absurd and egregious behaviour'

Sometimes, taking the high road is a luxury you cant afford. Sometimes there is no high road. There is often talk of 'being the better person'. According to whom?

Its almost as if some of the commenters live a life completely free of conflict.

I know I could have worded this better. I need a LOT more coffee. Reddit's native search leaves a lot to be desired, so I'd try https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/

Just based on what you said though, I fully believe multiple people could post from either side in a short period of time. It blows my mind how often I see people bring young kids to the park and just kind of let them wander. I'm a grown adult who knows to stay out of the way and keep soft knees and I've had my shit rocked by a big happy idiot not looking where they're running. Deleted means deleted by the user.  Removed means removed from either us or the admins. Not me. I really just read the post...especially in the 'HOT' section. Very few apparently, because often there are some really outrageous details or comments in the Summary Bot that put an entirely different spin on the post. > Fake stories?

It’s this one nearly every time.

Or rather it’s the admins automated ban evasion tools catching someone evading a prior ban on this sub which almost always means we’ve banned that person at least once before on a different account shitposting.  It’s extremely rare for the admins to suspend someone on their first strike for anything but ban evasion. >wrote a response but then come to find it's locked when I tried to submit my comment

Dont let the mods fool you with stories of ban evasion tools. They wait until a second or two before you post and then Bam! Locked. Mwahahaha. That sounds like your describing a lot of different events, so it’s hard to say what’s happening.  All we mods can do is lock a discussion and/or remove it from our sub’s front page.  If it’s actually DELETED, the user did it.  If the user is suspended, that’s something only site admins do.  This is something they would often do if there were a lot of complaints about one user coming from mods or users, but they really don’t communicate to us about it so we rarely know until after the fact that it’s happened. To add a bit onto what others have said - it's most often actually more effective to objectively and civilly lay out what someone has done wrong than insult them. 

If you tell someone ""you're an awful person who deserves to be alone"" they're gonna rule you off as having bad intent, or just use it to see themselves as the victim. But if you say something more like ""what you did was cruel, and you should try and put yourself in that persons shoes and understand how you hurt them"" that's not only constructive, but they're more likely to be open to that.

I do however absolutely get the annoyance of having to be civil with abusers etc - I'm normally on the no kidneys for abusers train. But in a forum like this where (assuming the post is real) they have come looking for feedback, it is more constructive to jsut be objective.

ETA: this reminds me of posts I see a lot here where X person says something cruel to OP, so OP insults them back, rather than confronting the behaviour. E.g. ""they called me fat so I told them theyve been divorced 3 times"". Its way more effective to look someone in the eye and say ""what you just said was unfair and cruel and you should apologise"". Adding on to what everyone else says. Don't act like a Redditor

I get it. You're anonymous and you can say pretty anything you want with little risk of it affecting your irl. But remember, you're talking to a real-life person (see reddiqute). Like others have said, insulting people isn't gonna help or make them change their ways. 

Also remember, this is Reddit. Whenever you read a story on here, there is a good chance someone made it up. A lot of it is ragebait designed to intentionally rile you up and made you angry. Don't fall into the trap and get yourself worked over some poorly-written fiction that won't affect your life Snowman hits one of the big points for why this rule exists for the sub.  What's also worth considering is that we want this space to be a place that people are willing to make themselves vulnerable and open themselves and people they potentially care about for judgment from others.  Plenty of posters still care about the people they're posting about and don't want to see that other party insulted or attacked.  That kind of behavior (especially when the OP is the one being attacked) makes people less willing to post here.

Another thing to consider is that nearly a million different people visit this subreddit every day.  Those third parties can and do stumble across posts about themselves.  Seeing hundreds or thousands of people insult them based on a one sided story of a single event in their lives isn't going to be a fun experience.

Building off that (posts being a one sided recounting of a single event) we really don't have enough perspective or explanation to make any judgment on the person as a whole.  Think about mistakes you've made and times you've been an asshole in your life.  Would the insults tied to those specific actions be appropriate to label you as a whole person?  The spirit of rule 1 and what we're really aiming for here is trying to focus the discussion on the actions people did and morality of those actions rather than trying to attack the person as a whole.  Doing someone horrible doesn't mean that person is a horrible person.  It just means they're a person who did something horrible.

This is a total tangent but it's something related to this that changed the way I approach some situations: not attacking someone's partner when they're talking about the abuse they're experience is a pretty important idea to carry with you if your goal is to help the person.  [Here is a great guide on helping a friend](https://www.joinonelove.org/learn/help_a_friend/) from one love.  That idea goes as far as refraining from even labelling the person as abusive and instead focusing on how the person you're talking to feels and the behaviors themselves.  Here's the quote:

>Sometimes, our instinct is to immediately label the relationship as “abusive” to drive home the severity of the situation. This instinct, however, can cause your friend to retreat and shut down.

When we put together [our resource guide for those that might be in unhealthy or abusive relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/relationships) I learned a lot from the resources shared by the domestic violence professional we worked with.  Understanding how important the language we use when speaking to someone we think needs help was really eye opening.  It's changed the way I personally approach those situations as well.  A common refrain in modmail is users thinking they're doing good by attacking an OP's partner they think abused the OP.  Understanding that in addition to violating our rules those comments are probably the opposite of helpful validated this standard applying equally.

Anyway, that's definitely a lot of rambling there.  Ultimately ""why does rule 1 exist and protect everyone"" is a really big question and a good one.  It's one that we've talked about as a mod team a lot and have written a decent amount on.  But a lot of our effort with users is spent on explaining what the rule is and how it's enforced because it's not really possible to have a conversation about the *why* without understanding that how and what first. Because they're still human. They may be cruel and hurtful, but they are human and no human deserves the weight of the collective coming down on them. See the Sarah Z video I linked further down, because she has a good section on how internet justice by definition is unjust.

However, if that doesn't resonate, there's a simpler answer: because that's the price of posting here. We agree to follow the rules even if we don't like or agree with them, or we go elsewhere.

ETA: and if you see people actively being uncivil in the comments, just report them. I find knowing that someone won't be allowed to hang out here more satisfying than being mean. The thing is, being rude just makes the target switch off. Or engage in a slanging match.  I have a sense neither of them is what you are aiming for. I was given a 30 day ban for ridiculing someone with incredibly misogynistic opinions on ""traditional"" relationships because I used the word for an open palmed hand movement to the behind to mock their 1950s gender dynamics. I was told that was ""encouraging violence"".

I would have been fine with that had the mod not been a total tool in their response to me about it. I asked ""A bit harsh no?"" and was told ""NO"", with no other response.

Basically, don't bother yourself about it. The mods are just incredibly strict about what language they allow/don't allow. It's nothing personal even if they are a bit power-trippy with it. You might have better luck joining in on the related conversations going on deeper in the threads. Alot of the discussions are not only entertaining but also parse out the original post into smaller elements. You might enjoy it. Yeah, that's the inherent issue with downvotes.  As long as they exist enough people will use them as a disagree button that there will be a negative impact in a discussion based sub.

I love that reddit has them.  They work well on so many spaces here.  It's just specifically a discussion based sub like this that the negative impact outweighs the positive for me. And it's 20 times worse that it happens in this thread. People come in looking for clarification or to talk about the sub and their experiences, and this shit happens. It's just sad. I've never understood why people use the remind me bot anywhere. It's not hard to save a post and look at your saved posts tomorrow.

But as for why it matters: I've seen threads on other subreddits where there's 1 actual reply and a dozen remind me comments. That's not a huge deal on the big popular threads here, but the proportion of those to the ones that only get 15-20 replies is pretty darned small.

Now think about it: you come here because half the people you know are saying you're wrong for something you thought was reasonable and you're starting to doubt yourself. You write up a post that's fair and gives both sides and ask for impartial judgment. And of the 30 comments you get, 2/3 are people either prompting the remind me bot or they're the bot responding. Your actual problem is literally entertainment for people who can't even be bothered to check up on it without being reminded later. Does that make you feel particularly good? Why would this possibly be a power trip?  Those comments are reported as spam and we treat them as such because they are.  They're also entirely unnecessary because as noted you can simply message the bot.  We ban virtually all bots encourage spam like that. >Things like this make me really feel the mods here are just on a weird rampage

Not if you understand the history. This sub used to be moderated by one massively overworked guy posting from a whole bunch of accounts. The move to a room full of monkeys chugging red bull and working the spamjaculator machine turned out to be a disaster. 

Thats why they brought in the AI moderator. A wildly malfunctioning mysterybot-esque monstrosity, but in a sexy robot body. What you see as a rampage is merely an inevitable consequence of the reckless decision to give the AI robot super-strength and an incredibly high sex drive.

Of course, the 'mods' will deny this. To admit it breaks the third law. How does that work? We ask everyone who posts here to provide government ID? We ask people to give us their PII as a prerequisite to participate here? Or do we take people at their word? What, *specifically,* are you asking for here? Not just a vague idea, but explain exactly the mechanics of the ask you're putting on us. You don't make that post. AITA posts are about interpersonal conflict, and online arguments aren't included in the definition for this sub. Debate bait posts are also not allowed,and your post would've been classified as that, as there's no way to put up an ""am I right about my opinion on this political/social issue"" without it being debate bait. Finally, even if those rules didn't exist, your post was about a post where someone gets shot. That would go against the no violence rule and get it removed immediately. [submit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/submit?type=self) Parenthood is taking responsibility for a literal human life that had no choice to be brought into being.  Often it’s a life that you personally chose to create.  When you take that responsibility you have a moral imperative to appropriately care for that human being, because again, they don’t have a choice in any of this. As someone who has an incredibly absent father, if he had too much responsibility at work to deal with a child, he shouldn't have had one. He has just as much responsibility as the mother does and there's no way someone would say that about a mother because she physically has to be there for the first years of the kids life. I have zero issue with people suggesting divorce or breakup. If the opinion of some online strangers is all it takes to make someone seriously consider that, the relationship wasn't in a good place to begin with. Being divorced didn't mean they deserve nothing in life and are worthless. Where did you get that it's? People say it because the posters are in such awful relationships and anyone would be more happy alone than in a horrible marriage. It feels like the only people who suggest divorce on a whim like you’re saying are teenagers who think getting a divorce is as simple as canceling a subscription. Another user posting something in the forum about having an age verification next your username which I think would go a long way in keeping these lazy “get a divorce” comments off the top comments. Which then allows for the OP to get some advice they can actually use. And people saying “well you don’t have to listen”. That logic kind of just destroys the whole point of this sub even existing Re divorce - who in their right mind would start a divorce based on what reddit says in response to a brief, one-sided post?

Where I live, there are only a few valid grounds for divorce. They are unlikely to add another labelled ""Reddit said so"".

Those are your opinions about fatphobia. You are as entitled to have them as anyone else here. You dont get to gatekeep their opinions. Thats how reddit works. There was a post today - something about fiance disinviting someone from a wedding - where EVERY SINGLE POST said divorce or run. With optional red flags.

There were only a couple of hundred comments at the time I read but wow. [submit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/submit?type=self) that's WIBTA You mean like WIBTA posts which already exist? From the FAQ: 

>How does [Rule 7 - ""Post interpersonal conflicts""] rule apply for ""WIBTA"" posts?

>    You are considering taking an action against a person

>    You have a reason to believe they will be upset as a result of that action

>    You have clearly explained why you believe they will be upset with you Isn't that advice seeking? Are you reporting those? I wouldn't even use the sub rules ""No violence,"" I'd use the sitewide ""advocating violence."" I believe both go to the mods, but the sitewide one has a chance of hitting them harder. Unfortunately it's only a chance because the team that reviews sitewide reports SUCKS, but it's better than glaring at it and hoping it goes away. First of all, your comment was not removed simply for accidentally misgendering someone. It was for arguing about why it's okay for you to misgender someone. This is covered in rule 12 (and was literally quoted in your warning so not sure the confusion?):

>    No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups

You have also had two additional comments removed for rule 1 - attack ideas, not people. That includes not using insults.

>I also thought we weren't supposed to call others AH in the comments

So I take it your ""glance over the rules"" ended at the part of your removal message: [""Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)

>Is reddit taking a political stance and ostracizing all non-conformers

Sure. If that's how your brain needs to reconcile the fact not all spaces are for you to start off topic debates that are, *at best*, tangentially related to the topic OP is asking about, *sure.* Tell yourself that.

The rest of us can appreciate the reality that this sub exists to provide feedback on the question OP asked. Not for you to soapbox about your opinions. You provided absolutely no value to the conversation by picking that fight, and believing you're owed any space for any issue you want to dig into is a level of entitlement we have elected not to cater to.

Hope this helps! Ok Man alive do I get whiplash reading these sometimes. One of the first comments in here this month was someone big mad that they couldn't be blatantly transphobic and debate the concept of misgendering, but now we have you - a textbook rule 11 and rule 12 - complaining we don't give a free pass to violate these rules when a trans person is involved.

Equity means exactly that - we're not going to give you a special pass to break our rules because you married a trans man, and instead give you equitable consideration of your post relative to our rules.

To make no mention of the fact, ***you're fucking lying.*** A couple months ago you were worried about raising a bunny in a dorm, and now you're in your 30s and married? You are doing a disservice to trans men and women everywhere with this shit. /r/AITAFiltered has all of the posts with significant disagreement in the judgments. I feel like my downvoted comments (and others with similar view to me) are treated as if it is that, when the situation and our responses are nothing like that. No, I think things like that are way above this subreddit's paygrade, which is dealing with low stakes teenager-tier squabbles. *sighs and opens up a can of coke* AITA already does remove posts about specific topics; that's what rules 5, 11, 13,and 14 are for, with 12 touching on it. The problem with removing posts involving the ""everyone is calling and saying I'm an asshole"" is that the scenario passes the Florida Man test described a few comment threads down. Moreover, one of the mods mentioned that he personally knew some people whose families did get involved in their arguments. That said, if those are the only people calling the OP an asshole (that is, if the OP didn't have a conflict with the person they took action against and the only conflict is that the 3rd party said OP was wrong), it's probably removable under rule 7. Thank you, I don't know how but I somehow managed when reading that rule yesterday to just completely miss the word recent. I need my peepers checked lmao It actually might be the same one but i honestly cannot remember. It was the same concept tho of running into the people somewhere or like family bringing it up. That does in fact count as not a current conflict. I feel like to be deemed current, it needs to be within the last week/month or so unless its an ongoing issue Agreed. Interesting. I had no idea there was a rule about it. My interest was more in the fact that parents do seem to get involved in their children’s personal conflicts with their SO.  And that seems ridiculous to me. Me too but another Redditor stated it was seen in their life multiple times.  So maybe people are that fucking weird. Lol Thanks for the input, as I said it sounds personally unrealistic, but there are stranger things Horacio :). (Mismangled quote on porpoise) Their bot clearly isn’t doing a very good job if people are slipping through the net! And how can they expect people not to talk about them if they send inflammatory DMs to so many people for no good reason? Fingers crossed you get the coveted DM ;) You’re right, I shouldn’t have reacted like that but I thought that since a bot was messaging me, no humans would see my message (oops). I do, however, think it’s insane and irrational that they get to hand out thousands of bans (and DMs) over nothing. I don’t want to and couldn’t join their sub anyway cos I don’t meet their stringent membership criteria but it would be great if they could stay out of strangers’ DMs just for posting in a sub they happen to not like. Knowing the mindset of the r/ breakingmom mods (didn't they decide AITA is problematic because y'all wouldn't set up an automod to remove all reference to their sub?), I suspect they would've seen that as harassment, too. The whole subreddit just seems entirely negative and miserable from the few times I've looked at it. That's just mean spirited. It's boring to you but important to OP. And that's gonna be a hard maybe. The number of people who'll look at a set of triplets and say ""you don't need that many; give me the runty one there"" the way someone would look at another person's fries and ask if they're gonna eat that is going to be vanishingly small. Ah. But does that really accomplish anything? Almost everyone uses a throwaway so they can't really be punished over it...or can they?

Interestingly, I just saw one of these and 1)bot comment can't be reported at all ~~2)individual comments can be reported but not for ""deleting before 48 hours""~~

So I think that reason might be pretty obsolete for threads, no? Happy Cake Day! I believe them. Just look for prank videos on YouTube. There are so many that are cruelty wrapped up in a ""prank."" Even classic pranks have the chance to go badly wrong. The bucket of water on a door? Best hope that bucket doesn't hit the targets head wrong. A tack on a chair? Hilarious until you remember how much chance there is for punctures to get infected. Banana peel on the floor? Haha, look at him slip and fall and break his tailbone! Not if they’re assholes. A lot of people seem to lack even self-awareness. I definitely believe the one about the hearing aids. They are so fragile. Ohh, you're spot on.

Thanks for the tip. Might sort by most controversial to see if there's a trolley problem type of AITA here lol Their brains however dont mature until 25. At that point the brain sends you a memo to inform you that it has finally switched on and is ready for action /s How old is every child on AITA? 

""Old enough to know better"" Oh I dont know. So-called 'facts' can be so limiting. Try just pulling your info out of your ass. Its incredibly refreshing!

/s Nah, pretty sure a seventeen-year-old who finally cries about missing Senior Prom because her parents won't hire a babysitter for one night after having her watch them as soon as she could legally be left alone with them to the exclusion of any other afterschool activities or social life is definitely TA. It's called helping out your family and she's being entitled. /s Yeah, it’s not really a format that encourages nuance I guess. Same thing as jumping straight to breaking up/going no contact etc. life is complicated but it’s more fun to go for the big noisy simple solutions. I seriously think a lot of these posts would fit just fins on r/pettyrevenge Hollywood will start stealing stories from here Oh absolutely, normally I just see it when the SO sucks and the comments are trying to be funny. After the first few times, its not clever! Yeah I was thinking that too. You’re probably right Aha perfect! Cheers ^.^ Thank you!! That's actually kinda impressive. The one tonight ""only"" broke 3 rules, with 2 more possible.

Do you actually get multiple reports if the same person reports multiple rules on the same post or does it overwrite with the most recent one? And how badly does that clog up the queue? There's been a couple times where I've clicked the wrong report reason by mistake and I don't bother correcting since I figure y'all will figure it out when reading the post. Dunno, I think that ""missing"" question is the one that is most critical. Because without the other person responding in some way, the thread is just about OP's feelings or behaviour in general.

Good to know you look when its reported though. If it has, I really hope the OP ended up getting the help they clearly needed. I wonder how many of these people who hate on fat people are in perfect health. Or is it fair to yell at them for eating pizza since it’s “unhealthy”? And obviously health determines your worth more than anything else (/s) This is so damn true! It makes me uncomfortable how quick people on this sub are to demonize fat people and act like they're doing a fat person an act of holy service by informing them of their size. Do they think fat people are vampires and cannot see themselves in a mirror? It's honestly shameful how narrow minded people are and shows how they equate being fat with being a bad person when weight has nothing to do with a persons character. AITA thinks fat people routinely try to squeeze into clothes way too small for them, as if this isn't a trauma we go through every time we go clothes shopping Really? I've literally never seen extreme fat acceptance on a post involving a fat person. I do, however, always take OP's pretty consitent description of fat people in their lives as food-gobbling monstrosities with a grain of salt. And BMI has been debunked, was never meant as a medical tool, and has literally never worked for Black women  soooo. I'm 47 and I can't handle the dogpiling and anonymous harassment (aka downvoting). How much worse it must be for teenagers. The app doesn’t unfortunately On the app you can sort by old. TBH with a few exceptions I’m really not a fan of extrapolating “patterns of behavior” that go way beyond the information the posters provide. Often it turns into inventing whole storylines to justify an extreme judgement or proposed actions.

”My husband got mad when I spent $1000 we don’t have and called me selfish. AITA?”

”NTA - financial control is behavior of an abuser! If you told us about this incident, I bet there are 100 more cases and he’s also gaslighting you, controlling your relationships, and basically keeping you under house arrest! What a toxic, horrible man! Get your go bag, go NC, and get a divorce lawyer now, because you’re in danger!” I've seen some truly ridiculous justifications for divorce in this sub. I know you also see this on relationship advice and other subs across Reddit as well, but here it seems to be turned up to 10. 

Commenters here have a massive case of justice-boner and really don't want to see anyone forgiven or conflicts worked through for the most part.  They want to see the AHs of the post pay and get that they think is coming to then. After all, reading and commenting on posts here in entertainment. 

It's no secret that a lot of what gets posted here is most likely fake, but some of it isn't  ( I assume), and for whatever reason there is a certain type of person who can't comprehend that the person they're casually telling to make a major life change over one agreement is a real human being. 

It's gross. Hmm, interesting take. I'll keep an eye out. Good points, but some of the relationships in these posts are *really bad*. How many posts have the husband/wife unironically calling OP ""selfish or inconsiderate or mean or evil"" in an argument and *never* walking it back? I'm pretty thin-skinned tho, so maybe that's actually how normal couples talk to each other. I think it's worth tolerating the bad for the OP who really needs to hear it and is posting for a reality check from being gaslit. 


It sounds at worse like an annoyance but the best result seems like it's worth it. You caught me, skippy. I'm always out and about campaigning for worse working conditions for stay-at-home moms and they know it. They've had a bounty on my head for years now but the best they've been able to do is ban me from a subreddit I don't even want to take part in.

It just really bugs me when I see these arguments and someone's arguing that it's really not 24/7 or even all 8 hours/day when the other parent is gone and they're being downvoted. What do these people think single parents do when they're home with their kids? Do they expect a single parent never uses the bathroom, never gets 5 minutes alone, etc? It's just a complete lack of empathy and thinking and it's maddening. This is something I like about talking with you; you've had similar experiences to me with a spouse who works long hours. My wife's been working nights for over a decade, and the last 5-6 years has had jobs that require a lot of double shifts and overtime. There was even a period of about 2 years where she lived at work for 6 out of every 8 days, all while I was working my regular 40 hours out of the house and taking care of the kids and handling the chores. It's tough as hell, but it's doable.

I think one of the things that really gets missed is that the partner who works out of the home really isn't getting a break for those 40 hours. Even the commute home isn't a break, which I've seen claimed when someone is looking for a bit of wind-down time. So the expectation seems to be that someone clocks out, deals with the commute home, comes in and immediately picks up on the childcare and chores and maybe doesn't get any break at all until the kids are in bed 3-4 hours later and will still need to ket up if someone wakes up in the middle of the night. Meanwhile the poor put-upon STAHP gets their break and has a chance to recharge and then gets another after the kids are in bed and their workload is halved immediately no matter what. People just really don't seem to get what goes into both sides of parenting, I guess. Please report any post you believe to be rule breaking!!! If something is still up that shouldn’t be, chances are one of two things has happened: we haven’t been able to get to it yet or no one has actually reported it. Duplicate reports are fine (honestly they’re more than fine, they’re appreciated) so fire away!!! Isn't there a revenge on people section? Like sweet revenge or something? To me it wasn't a revenge post because the OP's reaction was to something that happened immediately before. Yes, it was part and parcel of his mom cheating, divorcing his dad, and marrying her lover; however there was still a specific point where this stopped being an ongoing issue and became a specific conflict. It's like when someone faces hostility repeatedly from their partner's family and they finally do something later to hurt them. There's always a breaking point where this specific insult or action was too much and they responded, and that's where they ask us to judge. It's impossible to give judgments on cheating posts. People become black and white thinkers and if you don't say OP is NTA you get downvoted to hell. 

Literally someone on that post said anyone who didn't say NTA was a cheater. I mean, I don't like cheaters at all either but there's no reason that should follow them the rest of their lives and they should have no happiness after that. Everyone gets some shit in their lives; no one needs to go out of their way to make someone else's life worse. Which isn't to say anyone needs to go out of their way to make someone's life better after being hurt. Just that intentionally hurting someone in retaliation isn't as cool as commenters here make it out to be. The dude went out and bought a book about a woman who leaves her husband to live with her lover, after which apparently a shit ton of bad stuff happens to her, and gave it to his mother, who he supposedly loves according to the start of his post, with the intent of hurting her because he saw her happy with her new family. And people are okay with one person hurting another if the other person did something bad at some point. Hell, the person who told me that she does deserve that also told me ""she deserves any bad thing that happens to her.""

Maybe you're okay with this bullshit thing where revenge is cool and fun and we should be trying to hurt those that hurt us, but I'm kinda really sick of it actually. Intentionally hurting people isn't moral and I wish to all that's holy that commenters here would get that through their heads. > boring and witless

The biggest Reddit comment sin. The mod team has had extensive discussions about how annoying certain overused boring witless rule 1 violations can be. A couple of our mods can give a great soliloquy on the various iterations of “and the audacity of this b” Solid points all around, thanks! Well now that it’s been brought up, I feel like I should start something. On one hand that's great to hear, but on the other you've ruined my mental image of the rest of you dragging the Rogue Mod off in a straightjacket while they yell ""you can't handle the truth!""

(In my mind you also all live in the same house btw) As well as people being human beings and inevitably doubting themselves when everyone in their life tells them they're wrong. Still doesnt mean the neighbour has to deal with it… if I were neighbour though I would have reached out to landlord about my rights to the peaceable enjoyment of my home being breached, and I have two kids lol Oh they're out there. Trolls and karma whores who are desperate for fake internet points post the most shocking and disgusting things because that's what gets you karma on this site and I hate it so much. There was a troll here a few months ago who repeatedly posted threads involving people peeing in weird places. Many of those posts are fetish bait to get commenters to share similar stories; the most egregious one I can think of was either here or in a relationship advice sub where a guy claimed his girlfriend poops in the woods every morning. Cue clueless commenters regaling OP with stories of times they have pooped outside, have had to pee in the bottle in the back of a car, etc. Ah thank you!!! Even better, they should enable disabling downvotes. They serve no purpose here except as the disagree/fuck you button. Reddiquette says to use downvotes for bigoted or off-topic comment, but there's reports for that, so there's no need for them. > As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed. Damn, I just realized I put rule 5 when I meant rule 11. Not that a rule 5 discussion isn't warranted, because there's a lot of minor stuff that I don't think people see as violence that the rule covers, but we badly need one in rule 11. I don't have stats to back it up, but I think I report about five times as many rule 11 violations as all other kinds combined. Yeah I'm thinking of the spate of literal shit posts... or the one who keeps posting about being ugly... there's a few... thanks for the reply though that's useful to know I like both aspects of it on new posts. I don't want people seeing the most popular or oldest stuff first, reading, agreeing, and adding to the snowball effect that post is already experiencing. I want to see more competition and votes spread more evenly so that there's more nuance. I want to see ESH and NAH have a chance because they're not buried under a dozen top level comments dunking on someone in the post. I want this subreddit to be a better snapshot of actual morality rather than a place where bad behavior is lauded except in certain cases. That makes sense, yep. I keep forgetting that the vast majority of the story in here is being written by a person who more than likely has a vested interest in making themselves look better/more polite/kinder etc. Good point well made. Oh good grief what have I unleashed on the world?! Upvotes and downvotes literally encourage the ""echo chamber."" Instead of upvote = adding an interesting POV or piece of discussion it has become upvote = I agree and downvote = I disagree and you are stupid True yeah What’s sad is that while Reddit’s built in polls do something similar (you can’t see the current votes of the poll until after you vote) the lack of modding features around polls means we couldn’t even use those.

They were a great feature for the best of voting, but just don’t have the features needed for posts here. It’s an interesting idea but I’m not sure I’d do well with it. 

I don’t actually always agree with my initial judgment. Sometimes I have a gut reaction, but reading other comments changes my opinion. And I don’t think that’s a bad thing. We all have blind spots, sometimes we miss things, and I think the ability to change one’s mind and “be convinced” is actually healthy. Info: OP does this happen often? 

OP: no

Redditors: I have already decided YTA so I will just call you a liar and downvote you Definitely not the place for reasonable or polite discussions.

""I am sure we are all mature enough that we can have an adult and thoughtful conversation about this.""

""Fuck you Mr Poopypants. I hate you!"" Yeah, it's definitely getting kind of ridiculous lately. I got downvoted to -300 something last week, haha. I don't really care b/c I've been on reddit for a long time and don't even notice unless I go into my comment history for some reason, but it's so harsh to newbies or people who have low karma. It'd probably be better if it capped out at -30 to -50. And if the mods enjoy the post it’ll stay up If it's judgment bot leaving that rule 8 removal message it's as simple as the admins automated ban evasion tools catching and banning the poster which is almost always for ban evasion.

Otherwise there's a decent chance this is a specific troll with a pattern we happened to pick up on.  Sometimes having a dozen of their posts in different tabs and reading them all at once can reveal unexpected things. That’s just bringing a regular paternity claim against someone. It’s going through the courts and has a lot more steps and notifications (that the guy would almost have to be willfully ignoring) before he is declared the father. Mothers haven’t been able to just “include him on the birth certificate” (I’m quoting from a particular fake post about a wandering biologist that’s still up) since the 90’s. Sorry we’re not allowed links in this section. Google is free honey. I just looked myself, if you don't sign the acknowledgement of paternity then the other parent needs to get a court order for paternity testing. No one's getting a court order in three days lmao >I don't like downvotes. At all

Any particular reason why? I mean - the functionality is there.

Tbh I get where you are coming from. The things I downvote fall into the category of 'should probably be removed'. But I understand that, for instance, making 'balls-to-the-wall stupidity' against the rules is impractical. Really this sub has a a bias against anyone who isn't OP unless they are blatantly an AH I hadn't thought of it like this before. Where I tend to see what looks like a gender bias is in how the comments handle posts. When I read through chore posts, for instance, a man complaining about his SO tends to get more questions about how chores are split than a woman writing a similar post. It also seems like men are believed less on those posts than women are.

That said, I obviously don't see every comment on every post, so I don't know what I'm not seeing elsewhere. Also, the comments that stick with me are the ones that cause more of an emotional reaction. Even if my logical thought when reading those comments is ""yeah, that's fair actually,"" that doesn't override the kneejerk ""hang on, that's a bit harsh"" that tends to come up. There's also confirmation bias in play as well, where we tend to see things that confirm what we expect to see. Go into posts thinking that you'll see someone calling a guy who doesn't do chores a lazy man child and you'll spot that comment a lot quicker and remember it better than of you read the comments expecting the OP to get a fair judgement. Internal biases always warp our view of other people's biases, too, so what we think we see from others might not be what we see. It all adds up and becomes impossible to really state that there definitely is a bias one way or another around here. I saw that part but that doesn't negate the fact that the divorce was awful for his son and that he did nothing to get him help.

Bring him to a family therapist where he has supervision, have him talk to a guidance counselor maybe. Heck, if OP is 16 now then online therapy 100% existed in 2015/2016.

Sometimes we have to put our past pain behind us for the sake of people we care about, ESPECIALLY children. You summed it up perfectly. I guess that’s just the nature of this type of platform/interaction Maybe. For me personally though, I want to help people. That requires critical thinking to be able to adapt to each situation that is presented. That and situational analysis skills. Critical thinking is definitely used here. It’s literally analyzing information/a situation in an unbiased in order to form a judgement. ""Why is there no break up question day?"" the posters ask

""Because you all think every day is break up question day,"" the mods wearily reply as they remove the 600th such post this hour. This list gave me a sensible chuckle!

I've actually thought about wedding Wednesday before, but I kind of wonder about the externalities. Like encouraging more wedding posts by having a promoted, dedicated day, and encouraging trolls with the fodder of the day.

The annoying fact is weddings are huge sources of drama for so many. We had a pretty drama-free wedding, but still managed to piss off a couple relatives. Oh yeah, absolutely I agree with you on long threads. The exchange that spurred me to make that comment one where it went me -> other person -> me -> 2nd person pointing out something I'd said in the first comment, though. Lol. 

But also, I've even had people come at me with 'but blah blah' and the 'blah blah' is something that I've talked about or addressed at the tail end of the comment they're replying to... Making it obvious they didn't finish reading. It can be funny, but also really annoying at times :P Very fair point. I was trying to raise awareness of this most recent ""ayfkm this cannot be real?!"" news story in a humorous way. (I think I failed lol.) Thanks! Correct. Fixing it now. Thank you, I will check the feature out. Yes exactly. What are these posts even trying to achieve? They often sound like a passive aggressive way to show the other party ""SEE?!"" Both careers do pay, just not as much as the OP would like and the OP of the opera singer one also didn't want to make other concessions for his wife's career. The big difference for me, though, is that the opera singer was an opera singer before she married where the illustrator quit his job and jumped right into trying to make it as a full-time freelance illustrator. Jumping into being a full-time freelance anything without doing it as a side gig for a while to build contacts and a reputation isn't a good idea unless the market demand is so high you know you won't have issues staying employed or unless you're wealthy enough that it doesn't matter whether you work or not.

So, as it very often happens, the details of the stories are more nuanced than ""man bad woman good"" the way you like to claim. Is there an archive or do posts just go ""away,"" like non-deleted posts are closed and then...archived? Thank you. I do because I think it helps provide insight on different ways of doing things or how they might feel in the future looking back. Not really. Assholes is assholes and telling a teenager that they's doing asshole things is the first step to getting them to stop being an asshole. On the flip side, adults often hear ""they're just a kid, they don't know any better"" to the point it verges on gaslighting so it can be reassuring to know that the kid was definitely out of line, regardless of whether the response was proportional or not. Yeah but that can be said for any post here. Wtf Ah yeah, that's honestly my greatest weakness 💀 Does that work? That would make be laugh. Then again, I wasnt over-blessed with shame. 

But it sounds like something the dad from The Brady Bunch might say:

""you know by tattling on your friends, you're really just tattling on yourself. By tattling on your friends, you're just telling them that you're a tattletale. Now is that the tale you want to tell?"" LMAO thanks for the advice lol....possibly Hahaha how many in the 1800s were even carrying swords? 'and simultaneously use said lady as a shield' fixed it for you But, wouldn't it depend on the direction in which they're walking? >Asparagus is a finger food if you want.

But why would I want asparagus? Tiffany's Table Managers for Teenagers? Yeah, I got that too, though it was basically a joke gift.  

But the asparagus thing is absolutely a thing. And I live by it. (Note: this does not apply if it's anything other than asparagus spears.) I find she presents a wise combination of traditional etiquette, balanced with an understanding of modern mores. Some of the things I read on this thread that are presented as long-standing traditions (see any Bridezilla thread) absolutely go against ""traditional"" etiquette, and in fact, give rise to greater disputes. It did. I have no idea why, but I fixed it. Yes. All of them I could find. Some twice accidentally. This is a big part of the philosophy behind our civility rule and why enforce it so strictly.  There's obviously limits to what we can reasonably expect and enforce but the whole goal is working towards an objective and reasonable way to enforce those first four words of the rule:

>Attack ideas, not people

I've been selfish before, that doesn't make me a selfish person.  I've been done petty things, but that doesn't make me a petty person.  When we're seeing this tiny little one sided snapshots of a conflict it's important to keep that perspective and not judge the entire person on what's probably one of the worst things they've done. I recently watched a documentary called Fifteen Minutes of Shame, in which he features and talks about his book a bit, very interesting (and depressing) stuff It's a shame you're commenting about this without watching the video. She explains that she's guilty of these behaviors too, and doesn't point fingers at anyone for doing this. She points the fingers at social media companies algorithmically conditioning audiences to feed off of specific types of engagement, including drama like the situation she made the video about, and how it made for corporations to swoop in and make money off of it.

I mean it's an hour long, so I'm not exactly expecting anyone to sit through it unless they're actively interested or invested in the topic, but at least do yourself the favor of simply not opening your mouth if you don't really know what's being discussed in the video, to prevent embarrassing yourself. We've all done it. It's a human experience for anyone who's spent any time online. If she's still doing it, call her a hypocrite then but let's allow people to learn and grow out of bad behaviors. I don't think it would stop the ""AITA professionals"" who make it their life's work to post here, no. I think it might cut down on casual shitposting though.

Thanks for the clarification. Didn't know it was even an option or whether it had been tried. I understand, thank you. I have not posted any stories myself. good point, it does annoy me though lol And yet people will still ""helpfully"" tell a comment reply half way down the page to 'add a judgement or it won't count! :)' lol Thank you.

I got confused earlier when a post was judged as ""asshole"" but the overwhelming consensus among commenters was NTA, and even the highest-voted comment (which did go for YTA) didn't have too many upvotes (unlike some that get, like, 3K upvotes).

I assumed the bot was a little more sophisticated than that, but I have no idea how smart you can make 'em. This aged well 😃 Yeah i know but some of these posts leave you at the edge of your seat and wondering what's next. > YTA for responding in kind when faced with open hostility'.
> 
> 'YTA for using foul language in response to absurd and egregious behaviour'

That gets me every time. If you're going to dish it out be prepared to get it in return. I know some see that as an ESH situation, but context matters and you don't always need to take the high road when faced with someone taking the low road. It can be admirable when you do, but not YTA when you don't imho. 

Then again, maybe my username and flair are right. the way i see it (as someone who thinks a justified asshole is still an asshole) is that the sub isn’t, “am i in the right?” Thanks. So ""removed"" could also mean they didn't respond quick enough to the Summary Bot? The ""Why OP thinks they are TA"", is written by OP themselves. /s? No kidneys?

Withholding offal? Or auto-cucumber malfunction?

How mysterious! Yeah, this does sound like a more constructive use of my time. I am normally very compassionate, but for some reason this sub brings out the absolute worst in me. I shouldnt let that happen though. If I want to even have a chance of helping make a situation better, I've got to be civil. These are some very good points. I'm a very emotionally reactive person online so I'm probably a great target for folks like these. I should definitely pull myself together though. Whether the OP or someone else is the AH, I cant let them get to me like this. Thank you for this extensive explanation. A lot of this is information that I too can apply to my interpersonal relationships. Very insightful indeed One of my biggest pet peeves in this sub is OPs in NTA situations who get downvoted for saying that the other person isn't a sociopath and has good qualities as well. Especially when it's a garden variety conflict and not abuse. Or that they aren't going to call the cops/sue them/take revenge. I see. Thanks for giving me an actually well thought out and reasonable answer. I was half expecting for someone to insult me lmao Hm...I see. Wise perspective you've got there. Kinda funny too lol I havent bothered to message any mods about my warnings since I kind of assumed they would not respond. I dont mean to break the rules, I just lose my cool sometimes. However I did lack a fundamental understanding of said rule despite reading about it extensively, leading to my current predicament. So I said something about it here in hopes that it would start a productive discussion about the ""be civil"" rule. Yes, how dare those terrible power-hungry mods do such a thing as *checks notes* enforce the rules you agreed to when you started commenting on this subreddit and then decline to argue with you over something that's explicitly called out in the FAQ as not okay? I have been there. Honestly, though I take the temp ban and try not to make the same mistake again. Other subs will just perma ban you. At least they try and work with you here. On general principles, I will upvote any post with 0 or negative rating. Its not much but my way of trying to counteract this. Unless I read the post and it really deserves to be downvoted, which honestly is pretty rare. I don't like them anywhere on reddit because the misuse is too prevalent. I could accept them if it forced you to say why you were downvoting, with options like ""off-topic"" or ""verifiably false information"" (and maybe "" I don't like this take"" that upvotes the comment instead). But there's too many bad apples in this bunch as things are so now all the bananas are brown and squishy.

ETA: And I seem to be getting downvoted again, which isn't surprising. I'm not going away and this isn't going to make me change my mind. All you're doing it proving to me that downvotes are too misused to be rehabilitated. The hive mind is the biggest bully on the internet [Damnit. Must remove comment before they learn the truth!](https://media.giphy.com/media/5Zesu5VPNGJlm/giphy.gif) Alright thank you for letting me know. I appreciate you. That's fair I have been although understandably it takes time as the mods are presumably busy it's just a horrible thread. Also, that response was really mean lol. Geeze What's a warning? cool thanks! didnt know this sub existed I dunno how it goes where you are, but here pretty much the entire fmily will find time to call and tell you what to do when something, anything happens. I still remember when my uncle and aunt had a fight.

Not only did the parents interfere, it became a dog fight along the lines of- 'I knew I shouldn't have let her/him marry your son/daughter! your entire family is bad!'

In the end my dad got called as a 'nuetral party' to judge the issue. In the end my dad just told hte couple to talk it out. it worked. I laughed at porpoise... No kidding. I just wandered over there and I'm not locked out of the sub or anything. I've mentioned r/ breakingmom like 3 times in the last hour alone and I've been posting here for years. You'd think that bit would be salivating at the chance to ban me. Turns out im banned too. Bizarre. Luckily, nothing of value was lost. 

Arguably something of negative value was lost. A net gain then. Hurrah! Yeah, that's the gist of it. Anyone can report anything for harassment (and based on what we see in the queue, they do), so it was more with the admins/AEO acting on the report in mind.  

(PS, to stay compliant with the whole no links in the OF you should probably drop the r/ so it's not a link) 'FAKE' might be just as hurtful. The thing is, if we could all add verdicts, they would profilerate to the point where they became meaningless. My facetious ideas would be at the mild end.

A more reasonable extra verdict which would have been appropriate to a post I just read would have been ""OOF"" or ""YIKES"". But I dont think they should profilerate. 

I think simplicity and the smallest number of possible verdicts is the only practical option. Yeah im curious about that too. Surely any action the mods take is kinda meaningless for a deleted post from a throwaway? Reddit has tools the auto detect ban evasion. So, if we ban a throwaway and they post again on a different account the tools can pick up on it and suspend/shadowban the new account. Judging from the number of ban evasion reports to ban evasion account sanctions [Reddit reported last quarter](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/su8p2e/q4_safety_security_report) it's incredibly effective too.  

That's what's happening when judgement bot removes a post for rule 8. More often then not it's repeat trolls that get caught (why we have it remove for rule 8), but other bans will get caught up in it too. 

Side note: Deleting a banned account is a terrible idea! We can't unban deleted accounts. And the ban evasion detection tools will continue to look for info from the deleted account. It creates a situation where the user is banned on all future accounts without an option for appeal. I don't believe any of those either. The majority of the online ""pranks"" I think have all involved parties willing and well aware before the video starts rolling. Hey, I get that perspective.  

There's definitely a high ratio of real posts that get lost in /new or /rising because they don't have the drama to reach the front page.  If you're here for the laughs the front page is definitely the way to view the sub.  For more real (and also more mundane) posts sorting by those other options will show a lot more.

From a moderating perspective we try to make sure the bar for removing a shitpost is pretty high to ensure we don't remove real posts in our effort to purge the sub of shitposts.  While we love that people are entertained by this sub our main focus is viewing it as a service we can provide to the people that need it so we weigh ensuring we don't deny people the ability to post here pretty high.
 
Like you alluded to, that definitely does mean a fair number of fake posts make it through.  That said, you might be astounded by the posts that read precisely like shitposts that turn out to be real.  

A year or so ago there was a post that involved a parent letting their toddler eat cat treats because he would tantrum if not.  The OP had read the ingredients to ensure they were safe and tried a few themselves just to be sure so they didn't see the harm if it saved a massive meltdown. We removed that pretty quickly as a shitpost only for the OP to follow up in modmail and offer a decent bit of proof that the story was probably real.

There's plenty of other examples of what we were certain were obvious shitposts we removed only to be proven wrong.   Sometimes small details are changed for readability or space (I remember a post about a kid with a kind of cancer that's not measured in stages describe it as stage 3 because that's the way the doctor explained it and it saves time to follow suit rather than spend a paragraph teaching people about that kind of cancer.  Sometimes OP is unreliable narrator and simply doesn't understand something explained to them and continues that game of telephone.  Sometimes people are really terrible at their jobs, and while no OBGYN should do that thing there's a bad one that did.

Anyway, all this is just to share the kind of mod perspective of these issues.  Because you're right, there are a pile of shitposts involving kids.  The issue is always figuring out *which* of those are fake and which are just written poorly by a real person.  So many seem to be written by the kid acting like the parent too, that's often a big giveaway. Apologies...but ESH? If you want to dive through all of those old meta posts you can [sort by flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/search/?q=flair%3AMETA&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new) and find the same kinds of things being talked about in the open forums talked about before.

The only thing that changes is people's view of the subreddit before. No links in the open forum please.

To answer your question [here is a meta post we wrote a few years back on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fcinz6/meta_theres_no_assholes_on_the_front_page/) that's just as relevant today as it was then. >Do you actually get multiple reports if the same person reports multiple rules on the same post or does it overwrite with the most recent one?

Close, any reports after the first just get lost in the void.

>And how badly does that clog up the queue?

Not much really.  We approve roughly 40% of reports on posts so a few mistakes are just a rounding error.  Some report reasons are definitely used more accurately than others, but it's easy enough to see a mistake for those too. I’ll bring up adding it with the other mods. You’re right it’s absolutely critical in determining if a post fits the sub, I guess it’s so ingrained in us to look for it, it’s not something we added to the bot. I’m not even that fat (i view myself as chubby, 5’0 and something like 150?) and I’ve almost cried in fitting rooms trying to get a pair of pants on. In the post I’m referring to, the OP was called fatphobic because he was worried about his sister who was 100lbs overweight, gaining rapidly, engaging in disordered binge eating, and in denial about it (Now, the *consensus* there was that he was right to worry, but there were multiple posters insisting he was an asshole fatphobe). 

BMI has not been “debunked”. It’s not the whole story, no single number can be, but if you’re up in the mid 30s or 40s and not some sort of extreme athlete, there is a high probability you are carrying unhealthy weight. High BMI is strongly correlated to heart disease, type II diabetes, joint problems, even COVID complications. Yes, there are some high BMI people who are fit, and especially in the slightly overweight range the correlation breaks down, but when 300 lb sedentary women are using Serena Williams and olympic lifters to insist that their own size is healthy, that’s not science, it’s cope. 

This is exactly what I’m talking about, extreme “fat acceptance” or “healthy at any size” myths being thrown around as facts and people who don’t believe them being called fatphobic. I’ve lost way too many family members to obesity related disease to pretend that sort of “acceptance” isn’t harmful. I'm only 19 myself, if I comment and genuinely think I have a good take, and then people downvote me to the point of -100, I get p upset lmao but then again, I am a wuss >It just really bugs me when I see these arguments and someone's arguing that it's really not 24/7 or even all 8 hours/day when the other parent is gone and they're being downvoted.

I tend to go the other way. You cant convince idiots (or drunks) that they are wrong or 'its a little more complicated than that'. A waste of breath. I find it more productive to take the stupid idea and make it much more stupid: ""Why has God singled out SAHPs for the greatest punishment the world has ever known!?!?!? Each day is a fresh nightmare. An eternity in hell would be like a cool and refreshing mountain stream by comparison"". 

Sometimes it works and they take a step back. If not, its less frustrating as trying to talk sense to people who wont listen. >People just really don't seem to get what goes into both sides of parenting, I guess.

Maybe its as simple as few people having experience of both sides. Working full time and caring for kids full time.

Im surprised to hear you say that the commute isnt a break. I always found it so. Thats the thing I miss about working from home. As messed up as it often was, I used to enjoy the commute to and from the office. Then again, I have commuted my whole working life. Maybe im just used to it.

For me, all this parenting stuff is many years in the past - my children are all adults now. I still remember it well enough though.

I too had the 'working from home AND looking after the kids' thing, just not for more than a week at a stertch and they werent too young either. I can imagine that must be difficult. I love seeing the similar experience too!

>My wife's been working nights for over a decade

This has been our biggest pain point recently.  For years before kids this worked great and let us balance having time together and time to do our things fantastically.  But as the kids get older this gets trickier and trickier to balance sleep, time to ourselves, time with the kids, and time as a family.  My wife just got a new position that has her orienting on days for a few months and that's really helped things.  We still can't do everything we want every day, but it's easier to balance over the course of a week.

>So the expectation seems to be that someone clocks out, deals with the commute home, comes in and immediately picks up on the childcare and chores and maybe doesn't get any break at all until the kids are in bed 3-4 hours later and will still need to ket up if someone wakes up in the middle of the night

This is the thing that always gets me too.  If both of them are working, why does one party automatically get the break after an equal amount of time spent working?  When the working parent comes up you've got to split that time too and let the parent working out of the break get a break as well.

The last thing I want to do is dump chores and kids on my wife the moment she walks through the door as I go fuck off somewhere.  Same with before she leaves for work.  Evenings when we're both home are time for both of us to share relaxing, not just me.  

My favorite way to split that time as a stay at home parent is using my breaks from parenting to clean.  I used to hate cleaning, but now it's downright relaxing when it's all I'm doing.  My wife knows that if cleaning needs to be done all she needs to do is entertain the kids and I'll start working at it.  Both of us consider that a break! i did, but there was already quite a bit of engagement on the thread so maybe I was alone in that thinking. There are a few as I remember. pettyrevenge and nuclearrevenge are the only two I can remember. > Isn't there a revenge on people section?

a what now? You mean a subreddit? Well to me, any time ""purposeful cruel behaviour"" combines with ""special event,"" that is very rarely anything other than petty revenge.

But I understand your point about the timing being a factor. Absolute truth.  But marriages end for all kind of really complicated reasons that we will never know about, and cheating is often not what ended things. A little 'boring and witless' is to be expected. Cliches are inevitable. Possibly they get together and make plans against us. In Casablanca perhaps. 

The things that really grind my gears are the cliches that are either factually or contextually wrong. Things that people have read on the back of a cereal packet and spew out for motives I dont care to examine.

""Everyone would benefit from therapy"". Factually incorrect. There are sets of people that no conscientious therapist would take on. Its like a cult.

""Their brains are not developed until they are 25!"". This, whilst not false, does not mean that under-25s cant think straight. If that were so, any 26 year old would beat every 24 year old at anything that tested executive function. To generalize about brain function is ridiculous in any case. It is science made into a popup book. A nonsense born of lazy thinking. Its not that simple. 

The bowels are not full developed either. Go figure.  

Grrr. Now, why would you do this? Here I am, trying to enjoy my Saturday, after taking care of the yard work, and you have to go and bring this up.

Now I gotta sit here and be angry for a few minutes... You beat me to it. I was about to demand more mod drama before I read your comment. 

I am reminded of some legendary mod drama back in the day on Encyclopedia Dramatica.

But you cant go back. You can never go back. \*Sobs\* What do you think the landlord is going to do? I didnt know what you meant either. Until I remembered. My brain must have tried to protect me from the horror I think I'd prefer the cap, because some mods out there don't care about bigotry, etc. But I also don't think downvoting to multiple hundreds is particularly useful, lol, and it's really harsh on newbies. Cap out at -30 or so, even, and the point is there without really decimating someone. Fits pretty well with my removal ratio. Admittedly, I usually clear out the most highly reported and the super obvious ones when the queue is getting big. And rule 11 is generally one of the easiest to catch from the title alone (along with violence), so I can kind of cherry pick those while moving quickly and save us the headache of future uncivil comments on those posts. 

""AITA for wanting nothing to do with my mom"", ""AITA for being jealous that my bf follows instagram models"", ""AITA for telling my mom that dad is cheating on her"", ""AITA for not replying on dating app."" All made up titles, but I bet I could find a dozen real ones that are almost identical. Whilst I am hardly the one to comment on morality, I dont like the enormous amount of weight the early commenters have. And that is very much to do with contest mode. As soon as that goes off, the leaderboard is not just going to remain in the same order, it will snowball. 

From my point of it not that bad behaviour is lauded - its much more arbitrary than that. Its simply who is in the lead at the point contest mode goes off.

With regard to my issues about navigation, if ive read all the posts and come back a while later, i like to see the ones I havent read rather than trawling through a randomized thread. At the moment, the best way of doing this is to like by new or old. 

And there are some posts I like to keep an eye on for replies. Again, chronological order is the easiest way to do that.

In theory, I would agree with you completely. In practice, the chronological order functionality isnt something I care about in itself but it does make the two things I listed above far easier to achieve. We could both get what we want if there was extra functionality to facilitate that. ""Show posts you havent read"" and ""Follow this conversation"".

Of course, its possible in my ignorance that there are already ways to do both and I havent noticed Do tears spring to your lashes at the thought? Good point. Have never really thought that hard about the voting as such but it must be as you say. That explains why people upvote posts that just say ""This!"" who aren't adding to discussion but people also think this. Yes it's disgusting. It doesn't just wreck karma (which really only affects newbies) but it wrecks the subjective experience. Because when your comment is downvoted, it becomes less visible. This means that usually the only people who respond are people who are specifically looking for an easy target to make themselves feel superior to.  The negativity isn't just in the downvotes, but in typically all the replies. This causes people to not want to participate, thus reinforcing the hivemind. But they disguise that sentiment by phrasing it as ""Your opinion is fucked. Your post is something Mr Poopy Pants would write. I hate your opinion."" Yeah, when you put it in perspective like that, what am I complaining about? But I don't think it does just affect the newbies. It negatively impacts the sub as a whole, and it negatively affects the subjective experience of anyone no matter how much karma they've accumulated. Because when your reply is voted down, it loses visibility. That means that the people who engage with it are predominantly people who are *looking for easy targets to put down* and make themselves feel superior. So the downvotes spiral, and you get dogpiled. This makes you want to leave the sub, so the values underlying your response then also gradually get purged from the sub. And so the hive mind develops. Yup. So many posts break rule 13 and they don't do anything. I'm sure it is a specific troll! I just havent worked out what the tells are. They are very well written and very convincing. Lots of incidental detail and internally consistent.  
And as I said, every single one of these posts is going to get deleted for rulebreaking anyway, so its not like its in any way meaningful. 

I shall work it out eventually! ""Holy shit, this guy uses 'the' in every post. I've found his tell!"" Because what you see as reasonable, others see as balls-to-the-wall stupidity and vice versa. The problem is that even those stupid replies often contribute to the discussion. They're trite and annoying, but they still give a point from which a deeper discussion can be launched.

More importantly, downvotes are misused horribly. For every person that downvotes only stuff that doesn't contribute or is bigoted or in some way aligns with the reddiquette guidelines, there's 10 who use it as the ""I disagree"" or ""fuck you"" button. When a comment starts collecting downvotes, they tend to pile on. I prefer not to start or contribute to that behavior because it's no fun being on the receiving end of that. I understand that I'm just saying it's understandable that OPs dad doesn't trust therapists/psychologists.

Obviously he needs to get over that but I think it's unfair to pile on the guy when he has a real fear and doesn't want his son to go through what he did.

Edit: It's terrible that OPs father was abused by therapists/psychologists because he clearly needs help but the people that can help him are his trigger. > t’s literally analyzing information/a situation in an unbiased

What makes you think that its unbiased?  What is preventing the judgement to be biased? For me, they are the most boring posts of all. Sigh. I get that. And yes, that is totally annoying! I loved that link. The trouble is that, with regard to the question of ""would Florida Man do it?"", there is very little Florida man wouldnt do. Not the best yardstick I feel. Its just downvotes that auto-collapses comments I think Isn’t your 20s supposed to be about finding yourself and your passion? Is he really an asshole because at like the grand old age of like 25-26 he decided he wanted to try a new field? 

Does marriage mean we have to stay in a job we hate cause money until we retire in 40/50 years? If so, I guess there’s a reason I’m not married xD I don't know. I know that it should be shaming, but I suspect that most people shake it off. For that matter, I suspect most people here would shake off even direct insults because what does an internet stranger really know about you anyways? But it's something to throw out there when I'm particularly frustrated, though I tend to reserve it for those absolute gems who just can't keep their fingers off the downvote button. >Does that work?

For me it would absolutely work better than any insult.  In order for something to impact me it has to make me think critically about what I did.  When someone hurls an insult at me I don't respect or care about their opinion so it means nothing.  Make me pause and actually think about my behavior and I'm listening. Im not even sure when the book was from. It was old. Or maybe it was just copying older books. And these things tend to last a long time. 

There was also something about 'walking on the left' being something to do with jousting. I only remember the really strange stuff.

Another interesting book I got at roughly the same time was a cocktail recipe book - and this one was definitely from the late 1800s.

You would imagine that cocktails recipes wouldnt have changed much - youd be wrong. When it is perfectly acceptable to add cocaine and laudanum to drinks, that makes quite the difference. Lol Look up the German and Austrian dueling clubs. Apparently a ton of bored college students. Thats exactly the point. That would be walking on the right hand side of the road. Ungentlemanly! And 'mud shield lady' would also be hampering your sword arm. Left hand from your point of view. In short, you need your right arm next to the road and your left arm next to the 'laydee' Wow.  You think you know somebody and then they surprise you with this...

Asparagus is a top 3 vegetable for me if we're not counting mirepoix.  It's so versatile too.  It's fantastic on it's own sautéed with butter and garlic, grilled, broiled, steamed.  Hell, you can even steam it in the microwave.  Kenji has a fun recipe in the food lab for steamed asparagus and poached eggs with a walnut dressing that's damn good.  I throw it in a stir fry, a curry, and pretty much any vegetable mix I can.

I just made dinner and was disappointed I didn't have any to add.  The only vegetables I had left were carrots and peppers and asparagus would have been the perfect thing to balance that sweetness out.

Apparently I have strong feelings about asparagus... That's the one!  A kind of pretty shade of light blue is all I remember of the cover.  There was surprisingly some good stuff in there.  The ""just wait for another person's to be there to eat when out"" is a nice practical standard I still generally follow. 

I seem to remember they could be a finger food when specifically cut into thirds as well, but I also haven't opened the book in two decades.

Another asparagus fact I learned recently: just cut it.  The ""where it breaks is the right place"" is bunk as you can get it to break anywhere you want.  I think that was in the food lab. Thanks! Wait, what's wrong with Dyson products? >I think it might cut down on casual shitposting though.

Yeah, I agree.  From this side of the table it seems like casual and impulsive shitposting is a very small portion of the shitposters we deal with.  So many of the reactionary ones aren't just doing it once either, they're just finding new things to react to each time.  It would be such a small number of shitposters we'd be slightly cutting down on it probably wouldn't be worth the cost of not letting anyone post about a conflict while it's happening.

I've seen plenty of them talk about how they shitpost here in other subs too.  So often there's a ""I'll make a gender flipped post about this tomorrow and see what happens"" level of planning even for these simple reactionary ones.  Even for folks talking about doing it once or twice there's enough planning they genuinely wouldn't mind waiting a day or a week or however long.  They just want to stir up shit and don't care about the timing.

But yeah, all of this is simple to do with automod.  There's three different methods of doing this you can mix and match: account age, account karma, verified email.

I had kicked around the idea of ""if the account is newer than X days old they need a verified email"" hoping that would be a speed bump to trolls and not impact real person.  I asked around other mod teams and one shared that half of their brand new shitposting accounts already had verified emails *despite it not being necessary*.  It's so easy for shitposters to create a throwaway email they'll do it when they don't need to. 

While we haven't tried any of these, the general consensus from mod teams that use account age, karma, or verified email limits is they really don't do much. It won't count for the filtered sub, but not every post ends up crossposted over there. Just the really controversial ones. Ooooohhhh.... I'm one of those.

I've now gone to the about tab, to the FAQ page, and scrolled deep, deep down to the judgement section and I've read.

I don't know where I got the idea that every comment counted, but I'm glad now that only the top ones count. Now I'm relieved that I don't need to write my own judgement comment to participate, I can just find the ones that align with my views.

I wish this were explained on the about tab, since it is crucial to the functioning of this sub. If I remember correctly from a comment I read on here, the bot judges it like that to make it harder to manipulate- if it counted all of the votes and based it on the most popular, a few people would be able to spam the judgements and potentially change them, plus there's some issues with comments on other comments and comments with no judgement at all, I think. ha!  I was hoping to sneak it out today with no one noticing!  It's half done, but man it's a lot of copy pasting Sure. 

But who decides if it interesting enough that it MUST have an update? How soon would it be before this rule is broken? What if the situation hasnt played out yet before this arbitrary time limit is reached? 

What would the mods do in any case - lock a months-old post? Ban the person that made such an interesting post?

None of this would work. 

Seriously, check out r/BestOfRedditorUpdates.

All the good stories from here that have updates and a conclusion end up in there anyway. Yup!  When you don't see the usual stickied comment with the reply that was almost certainly the cause for removal.  Almost everything* automod does automatically comes with a comment explaining why automod removed it.  

\* We have a few very specific and infrequently used troll removals in automod that don't leave a public note, but these account for maybe a few removals a month. Yes, that is what the person you are replying to was saying. I see it too. 

For instance, the main post might say “AITA for being mad about X?” And might seem like either NTA or NAH, but then you see OP wrote in the judgment box “I might be tue asshole because I screamed at them and said they were going to die alone when they upset me.”

Not always, but occasionally there’s info OP adds to the judgment bot that isn’t in the story. 

I want to be better about reading it every time, I’d say right now I’m 50/50 depending on if I think of it or if the pieces aren’t adding up. Or if someone uses a reason in the comments that didn’t seem to reflect the post - it’s often an indicator there’s more info in the comments or judgment bot. Did you not want an answer to your original question? Or have I misunderstood your original question?

Just downvoting my responses is a little childish. Yes, that's my point. The OP often writes the main body of the post but then in their response to the Summary Bot they include another detail or point of view that completely puts things in another light. Commentors who don't read the Summary Bot response give judgment without knowing those additional details.

Ex. AITA post is like ""AITA for kicking my MIL out when she fed my 3mo baby peanuts?"" And then in the Summary Bot they add ""My partner told MIL peanuts were perfectly OK for the baby. I called the cops on MIL and had her dragged out of the house."" Lets just say there are other ways of achieving the same goal. Lol. Rudeness apart from being against the rules almost never achieves anything except people ignoring you >So I said something about it here in hopes that it would start a productive discussion about the ""be civil"" rule.

Seems like you succeeded then!

I totally understand and appreciate the approach here too.  I'm sure we've all had experiences of messages to mods going unanswered.  When it comes down to it moderators are just users with a remove button so you'll have all kinds of different experiences.  We make it a point to respond to every question that isn't coming from a super clear troll but it's understandable not to expect that.

I also love seeing these questions come to the open forum and getting to see all of the other users chime in with their thoughts as well.  A big part of creating and communicating rules is circling back to see if people understand what we're trying to explain and it's great to see that in action. I generally agree with a lot of the points you make on this forum. I understand your point.

I wasn't against the ban (hence my comment ""I would have been fine with that""), but of the mods dismissive attitude that felt more like they enjoyed it rather than enforcing the rule.

There is no need for your passive aggressive sarcasm, I don't have a problem following the rules. Absolutely. I hoped my tone conveyed I was more annoyed with the mods unnecessarily dismissive attitude than of the actual ban. >I could accept them if it forced you to say why you were downvoting

Omg I dont think that would be a good idea lol.

It reminds me of an ad campaign that Pringles did once. ""Complete the following sentence: Pringles make me want to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" There's 2 issues I see with this.

The first is logistical: there's over 3 million subscribers, an unknown number of people who wander by but don't subscribe, and something like 30 mods. On a subreddit where a relatively small number of people are creating top-level comments, a verification system works and makes sense. Here, the mods would probably have to double their numbers and still work overtime to keep up with the verification requests. That, or the participation numbers would drop severely as people decide they just can't be bothered. I don't think either is what the mods are looking for.

The second is that people would weaponize it when they argue. I don't think people should be expected to offer up any of their demographic information unless they actually want to. Im not seeing enough of an upside to justify any work for the mods given that the mechanism you describe is so flawed. Let fakes through? Borrow someones id? Trivially easy to circumvent. I bet I could find such things on the internet. And any stricter mechanism is never going to be practical. 

The whole thing would be performative. What fake ID could i present to give my comments more weight? I know - Ill photoshop something up to suggest that I am a senior engineer at NASA. Good luck arguing with me then!  

And the end result would be a license to make ad hominem attacks, whether or not the person had bothered to send fake id.

""Fuck you boomer"". ""Your brain isnt fully developed. You are under 25!"". ""You are not even verified. Why should I listen to a word you say?""

In short, I cant see this working or having the desired effect.

In any case, if you are that bothered, you can usually infer peoples background from their post history and posting style. AskHistorians deals largely in objective facts. They verify certain people because they are educated historians and they are vetting the credibility. We're all just a bunch of judgey assholes and life has told me you don't need any credentials for that.

Really, more than anything, I think it's a terrible idea to send personal information over reddit. I would not trust any major social media platform to take proper care. Yeah, that's the frustrating bit. You know the mods will get to it but until then the comments sit there and things devolve further. Someone who, in a mere three days, has 1) misgendered someone and then defended their ""right"" to do so multiple times, 2) called someone a bitch, and 3) called someone a piece of shit, calling me rude is not quite the biting commentary you think it is.

You familiar with the golden rule? Warranted It's the three mod removal replies you got so far in as many days. Banning topics won't mean that trolls stop posting.  It just changes what they troll about.  Instead the real people in need of feedback on those topics wouldn't have the opportunity to post here. Your dad is a saint. Thank you :) Are you sure you aren't banned?  Scroll down to their mod list.  If it's hidden that means you're banned.

You only get a ban message from a sub if you've previously participated in that sub. They’re slacking! I guess I should be flattered that they immediately jumped down my throat. Threat level midnight!! That’s the phrase they used when they banned me from messaging them after I told them to fuck off haha! I was just thinking “I’m not a fucking mom! I could never have been a member of this group anyway! Nothing of value was lost for me either!” Added a space to unlinkify it. Good enough? > 'FAKE' might be just as hurtful.

Hence why it's a report not a vote. In case you missed it [here's Handy's explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t4eh7s/aita_monthly_open_forum_march_2022/hzvee3m/) Everyone Sucks Here. An option for when both parties are in the wrong. Most everyone focuses on the two super binary voting options (YTA, NTA) but we also have ESH and NAH (No Assholes Here). BMI has been debunked, so I'm not sure what you're talking about. It's also not universally applicable even for overweight people who aren't athletes. And actually, there have been studies that shown that moderately obese people fair better in COVID recovery than their thinner counterparts. You need to question some of your own bias, I think.

I think I recall the post you are talking about and yeah, the consensus was she needed a wake up call and she was killing herself with no consideration for the state of her mental health or a disordered relationship to food. I'm not saying no fat person is unhealthy, I'm saying it's more complicated than that, and when fat people are unhealthy why doesn't it invite the same compassion when thin people are suffering with eating disorders or mental health issues? You and I feel upset because it *is bullying* and it's all the worse because we can't see who is doing it so we can neither confront them nor block them, all we can do to prevent it is just not comment on anything. Maybe it's different for you, but I don't really like driving. Public transportation wouldn't help, even if it was better in the States, because one of my biggest pet peeves (and issues with driving) is that other people have the audacity to exist near me. Which is really a very extreme way of saying I don't like being out among people much and I get frustrated with people easily when I'm out and about. So there's generally a low-level stress to commuting that ensures it's really not much of a winding down for me. >Im surprised to hear you say that the commute isnt a break.

I'm with snowman on this one.  Or rather, I'd say commuting is a break the same way that running errands without kids is a break to me.  It's definitely easier than other things, but it's a specific and necessary productive task rather than a ""you can do literally anything you want"" break.

Hell, even grocery shopping with 1 kids is a break most days. I think you mentioned before that your kids are both toddler/preschool age? That's a really tough age to be a WFH parent; we were lucky that my mom ran an in-home childcare and gave us about a 50% discount and was okay with us running a tab when our kids were that age. I think it's actually a bit easier when they're babies since they sleep so much at that stage and can be easily confined, and then it's easier again when they're school age because even when they're home from school they can entertain themselves without needing as much direct supervision. It does get annoying to carve out time after bed at that point, since they go to bed later, but the difference in how much care and supervision is needed more than makes up for it.

>If both of them are working, why does one party automatically get the break after an equal amount of time spent working?

This is my thought exactly! So both parents have been working for 8 hours and both parents will be parenting for the next 16, but only one parent needs a break? I get that in many posts about splitting up parenting responsibilities the STAHP is looking to redress the balance because it's heavily in the other parent's favor currently, but too many commenters want to make it unbalanced in the STAHP's favor. That's not making it fair, it's getting revenge.

> I used to hate cleaning, but now it's downright relaxing when it's all I'm doing.

I still hate cleaning, to be honest. We think I've got undiagnosed ADHD, especially since our son has been diagnosed and I share a ton of the difficulties that he has, and cleaning doesn't really ring the dopamine bell for me. It's necessary, though, and I can force myself to do it because the alternative is to walk into the kitchen and still have to clean before I can cook dinner anyways. I've found it helps to make the kids clean their rooms or the living room or something, because I tell myself I have to set a good example, as does putting headphones on and listening to an audiobook. It's still not a break for me, though; I'd rather watch a hockey game, play some video games, or read a book. and it’s not even about the cheating: she ends up killing herself at the end of the book. 

16 year olds are dumb but malicious and they know what they are doing. Op is totally the AH and the ppl justifying them is in denial Peddle your ""misunderstanding"" elsewhere. I'm not buying it and I'm not going to waste my time arguing with someone who's being deliberately obtuse. *""But the REAL version is The blood of the covenant is thicker than--""* No.

It was made up in the 90s to sell self help books. If you find it useful, great! Use it! But stop trying to historify it. Something, something, evil plan, \*finger steeple\* > What do you think the landlord is going to do? 

Exterminate, duh

/s I would be very surprised to learn that there are mods on AITA don't care about bigotry and who haven't been removed, and this sub is what I was thinking about when responding. I don't think a cap is a bad idea, and while I still think disabling downvotes on AITA is the better way I can see how setting a cap of 0 or -1 would work well, too. It's absolutely terrible. I don't think people who browse this sub casually realize just how bad it is. We get people in here once a month complaining about the wedding posts, but those are a drop in the bucket next to rule 11-breaking posts. This is a fun conversation because we actually have data on this!  The tl;dr: is that we measured how quickly after each post was made the top comment was made and the numbers are below.

Without contest mode the top comment was made on average 4.47 minutes after the post was made.

With a 30 minute contest mode that became 6.82 minutes.  With a full hour of contest mode that average become 11 minutes.

There is absolutely still an advantage to commenting early (this problem isn't unique to this sub) but based on the data a timed contest mode actively works against the early comment advantage.  

[Here's the post when we announced it with some more as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cjresy/so_we_decided_to_fuck_with_the_sub/) The trouble with following threads is exactly why I don't think it should be enabled for more than a few hours, but I think early comments get more benefit without contest mode enabled than they get with it. Without contest mode, you're basically racing to be the first person to use your judgement and the upvotes pile on from there. With it, there's more chance of someone seeing a good argument and upvoting it. Early comments will always have an advantage, but contest mode mitigates that.

As for bad behavior, I meant specifically posts where the OP does something objectively bad but it's accepted and praised because it was in response to something worse. Like ""AITA for calling my MIP a fack sack of shit? She's been trying to get my husband to divorce me and marry my childhood bully since day 1."" OP engaged in bad behavior, but since the MIL was worse, OP will have people jumping on like ""LMAO you're my hero I wish I'd said that to my MIL."" ARGH!!!!!!!! The cringe is still real, my friend. I’m almost tempted to go to the shop and find one of those magazines just so see what ‘the phrase of the week’ is. I’m guessing it’s kind of like people in banking call centres playing word games on the phone, like ‘ask as many customers as you can if they eat tomatoes’. That game and desk chair races (and seeing how far you could stretch the headset cable before it snapped out of the phone console or your manager walked in and asked what the hell you were doing halfway across the office with your cable almost clotheslining Phil On Secondment From Somewhere) were about the only things some days that stopped me from massacring entire teams of people with nothing more than a pile of With Compliments slips and a mouse mat. I bet you’re glad you asked now 😂 This!


jkjk yep. like I am shocked people are still finding and replying to my -10 downvote comment. like, ok, you disagree. Seems like a lot of people do. maybe I was even wrong. I am not some super person that can't make wrong decisions. But seriously? I am the most downvoted person there. I refuse to believe you are not looking for a fight. When you think you have it figured out send us a modmail and maybe we can confirm, if not we might learn a new tell :) Oh I agree about them being misused horribly. My feeling is it tends to be more of a 'fuck you' than 'I disagree' but that hardly makes a difference.

My point about downvoting stupid was more things that are unambiguously wrong than 'stupid' as such, like the example I gave about collecting things. Thats not just untrue - it cant be true and for me that cant contribute anything. Disinformation falls into the same category for me. Again, if he went to supervised family therapy or had his son do remote therapy (even with supervision) then there'd be no way anything like his experience would happen again. Typo! I meant critical thinking skills involve being able to set aside your own personal biases. You mean you don't want to know about what sex act or mundane thing made someone want to break up from their significant other? Or hear the story of their whole relationship to understand why that one thing was such a big deal? Well aren't you picky. Oh the florida man standard is actually one we use as mods!   We have it in our mod guidelines teaching how to mod rule 8 as well as the FAQs. I would just assume you were being sarcastic / satirical.

Like when there is a football game on and everyone is heated and you make a comment like ""Come on guys. Its not about the winning or losing. Its about the purity of the game. And the spirit of fair play"". lol

I dont recommend doing that btw. And definitely dont follow up with comments like ""Oh dear. What a shame the goal isnt 50 feet high!"" or ""That poor man seems to have twisted his sock!""

I sometimes think I am way too much of an AH to be allowed to post in this sub! Same, but the Mr Rogers reference wouldnt do it for me. Maybe I'm just not familiar enough with him.

Dont get me wrong, I agree with the strategy. Its that version of it would make me giggle more than anything else. Oh my, that's a different kind of party. I'd be interested in that cocktail book!

I always imagine cocktails in the 50s somehow incorporate mayonnaise and gelatin Damn. TIL! I have never cared for asparagus. My parents and younger sister all love it, so I've had plenty of chances to try it, and it's just never hit for me. Even trying it again a couple times as an adult was a failure. just give me some broccoli roasted with salt and pepper and that's a winner. Techies, I kinda love that you love asparagus. Just, yes. Yum! Yes!!! And, that ""pretty shade of light blue"" is called Tiffany blue. Their boxes and shopping bags are in that shade, and I think they've gotten legal rights to it.

As to breaking asparagus, I generally don't except for breaking off the thick bottom part prior to cooking. I'm sure you can break it anywhere, except for that very thick and fibrous bottom part, so finding where that is is helpful in insuring you're not serving the inedible part. Dyson is a Brexit-supporting asshole who abuses his workers and overpriced his products 🤷 this just shows a problem with this tbh. I constantly feel out of the loop when things like that happen cause I am Indian and have no idea what was going on.

like in that defense contractor employee's AITA (basically he got a job at a defense company that helped do bad things in a country that his Mom flad from and his mom basically disowned him for that and after years she tried to reconnect but OP didn't want to -> this AITA)

people were climbing on him for working there and how he was justified and all of that and all I could think of was- what are they talking about? Cause he used some kind of slang for defense companies and I didn't recognize the country either. Can be pretty irritating tbh.

/rant Right.  Although people spam comments all the time anyhow.  I've run into a couple of inexplicable downvote buzzsaws; I'm sure it happens to everyone. 

In the long run, as long as it can give the OP some clarity, it's all good. [I'm watching you, Wazowski](https://tenor.com/bgdAY.gif) I'm currently checking that sub out and bloody hell! Those are some of the wildest stories i have ever seen. OK. Seems like there have been a lot of ""quick"" DELETED posts of late, I guess they were the OP just noping right out when the first few judgments came in. You misunderstood my question. Yeah, I think you're right about this.  I definitely see it a lot too.

I'm still really, really, really hoping we can get the option to have a submission form with multiple fields to handle this much cleaner.  But I have no idea if the admins will ever run with that suggestion.

If it helps we make great use out of those JB responses!  It helps to clearly identify posts that don't have a conflict or are unfairly presented.  It's just a shame more users don't read them. True I'm glad my comment was beneficial to the community!

To be honest the main reason I didnt expect yall to respond is because I thought no questioning of the rules was allowed at all. But clearly that is not the case lol so I will be more willing to try to contact mods privately in the future!

Thanks for being willing to promote an environment of education and open discussion :) Just to give you bit of perspective from this side of the table on that interaction:

We get some 300 modmail messages a day to respond to.  *Many* of those messages are from people that genuinely don't care about the rules.  If I had a nickel for every time I typed out a longer thought out message explaining the rules in added detail and was met with a ""whatever, fuck you guys"" I'd probably be paid enough to continue sending those more detailed messages.  So instead we've learned to simply match the tone of the first message and let the user dictate what questions they actually want to ask for us to answer.

Your ban message included this line:

>Rule 5 - No violence, even in jest. 30 day temp ban, next violent comment will be permanent ban.

When your first message to us is nothing more than ""bit harsh no?"" that seemed dismissive so we answered the question as simply as you asked it.  

When you followed up with a longer question [we replied with an appropriate explanation](https://imgur.com/a/ElNbGlK).

We really don't enjoy banning for this small things.  We also don't enjoy unpleasant modmail interactions.  That's a big part of why we're not going to put more effort into the response than a user did in the question they asked.  As you saw, when you followed up with a more specific question then an offhanded ""bit harsh, no"", we followed up with what seems to me to be an appropriate answer.

We're a group of unpaid volunteers moderating this subreddit because we enjoy it.  We're not professionals and don't pretend we are.  Our role as moderators is no more important than yours as a user.  Any expectations you have of us we're going to have for you as well. Clearly you do have a problem following the rules, because people who follow the rules don't tend to get banned for not following the rules. But we'll leave that aside and look at your main complaint.

First, why should the mods deign to debate how they enforce a rule when your argument boils down to ""Yeah, what I said is breaking the rule, but it's not breaking the rule that badly, is it?"" It's like the speeding debate in real life. People get away with going 5 MPH over the limit so often that they think it's okay (myself included), but it's still against the law and could still warrant a warning or ticket. I might grumble about it to myself, but I'm not going to waste my time saying that I didn't break the law that badly. There was a line^(\*), I crossed it, that's the consequences.

Second, you said you used it to mock another person's stance, but the mods made it clear in the FAQ that NO mention of violence, [even sarcastic or joking](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what_if_i_think_it.27s_funny.2C_was_being_sarcastic.2C_or_couched_it_in_a_sweet_reference.3F), is allowed. Which means that their refusal to debate the rule with you isn't being a total tool. It's a flat denial that there's anything to debate. Could they have linked you that bit of the FAQ? Sure, but why? We're all capable of reading the rules and the FAQ and coming to this meta thread to get questions about them answered. It shouldn't be on the mods to chase people down and argue them into understanding the rules when posting is already an implicit agreement that we understand and will follow them.

^(\*And just to preempt any chance of this argument: the speed limit is not an immoral law, so let's not get into a debate whether or not I'd follow laws that are immoral.) eh, my bad. Could have worded it better, but I agree with you. Nah, it's multiple choice only. No ""other"" or write-in option. Make it an added step to annoy people and possibly make them think about why they're downvoting. I never called anyone a bitch. But I definitely didn't intentionally misgender anyone I just didn't notice that the person said there was a third gender and responded like it was a gentleman, then noticed later when someone pointed it out and then when I came here to ask what the policy is do you need to go back and edit comments or what I'm getting some mean spirited comment back. For the record I don't care what people's genders are, it was irrelevant to the Post at hand. Is that like an email or something? I'm a bit confused on where this appears? I haven't been on a heavily moderated forum online before so I'm just trying to understand, not hurt anyone's feelings by accidentally doing a rule misstep which seems like a big deal here. I feel like the trolls changing up what they're writing about might introduce some variety, and ultimately, quality back into the sub. Just a thought. Nah he's a homophobic mysogynistic asshole who did a thing right for once XD. If thats how you tell, then it turns out im banned. Wnich I find odd, since the first time i heard of its existence was when I read these comments a few minutes ago. 

I wonder why they do that? Seems arbitrary at best. I got a ban message but I’d never heard of that sub so I’m pretty certain I’d never interacted with it. Weird! Huh. Learned 2 things today. I assumed that if I was banned I wouldn't be allowed to view the sub at all. I guess they sure showed me, didn't they? I agree. Fuck them. That's perfect. To be completely honest even asking that much felt... wrong. Any other sub wouldn't be an issue, but it's a CYA not to give them anything to complain about 🤷‍♂️ Lol - are you sure we are not saying the same thing in a different way? 

The comment I responded to was calling for 'FAKE' as a vote. Which I disagree with. And it sounds like you do too!

I might be missing something here... Thanks Some apps let you report the bot comment, and individual comments should have a Never Delete an Active Discussion reason under breaks AmITheAsshole rules. I hear what you're saying, I really do.

> or parents talking about their children's interventions in school in ways that are Literally Illegal. 

The issue here is that schools can and do plenty of things that are illegal.  My highschool continued to employ a pedophile despite over a decade of detailed student complaints.  It was only after the police finally charged him they let him go.  Dude is still getting his pension but that's another issue...

The main point here is that plenty of teachers will break the law and do things they shouldn't do.  That doesn't necessarily mean the post is fake.  Obviously a good bit are, but it's definitely not all of them.

A similar note on the post about the five year old.  Like you said, that absolutely isn't developmentally appropriate language skills.  But there are far too many kids (especially one neglected by a parent like that) that are going to be delayed.  That's not to say that post is definitely real, it's just that we recognize that sadly it could be. BMI is just “weight over height”. You can’t “debunk” it, it’s just a number, like your weight itself. On a population level, it correlates to a lot of stuff. On an individual level, yes, it’s not the whole story, like I said. Doesn’t mean you should completely ignore it - if you’re pretty high (or low) on BMI you should at least talk to your doctor and get some of the other measures examined.

A lot of the “slightly obese is healthier” studies have a major confounding problem, because *underweight* people often got that way due to some sort of serious illness like cancer. 

There nothing wrong with having compassion for fat people. Hell, I AM fat people. Absolutely, mental illness may be the root cause of being overweight and should definitely be considered (I’d absolutely say the same thing if the poster we’d been talking about had seen his sister *lose* a bunch of weight unintentionally).But denial isn’t compassion, and that’s where a lot of fat phobia accusations seem to come from. Its unfortunate that it's a common thing on AITA... I pointed out that people were bullying a 14 year old in a post awhile ago, and people claimed they weren't bullying the kid just because the kid was entitled. I am so used to it (an hour commute each way for at least 25 years) that I can just switch off. I can see why most people find it kinda stressful.

I have always used public transport which can be like the wild west sometimes. Got some funny stories. I shall spare you the gory details. 

The only thing that has ever broken through in recent years is being stuck on a bus full of schoolgirls in the mornings. The stories they told each other would make any mans hair turn white. And then fall out. Probably. Its not even that i was eavesdropping. They were not using their inside voices. >one of my biggest pet peeves (and issues with driving) is that other people have the audacity to exist near me. 

This is why I don’t shop at Walmart. I’d like to pretend it’s some altruistic motive, but really it’s self preservation. Yeah, they're turning 3 and 5 this May.  Kindergarten is coming up way too soon too.

Thankfully I'm not working from home, I can't imagine how anyone does that.  While I do have a business teaching CPR and First Aid I've stopped the sales side of that and just do recertification for my current clients.  That's maybe a dozen classes a year and because my clients know and like me it's just a matter of a single email or phone call to schedule them.  Often they reach out to me too which makes it easy.

That's fantastic to have a parent able to help out childcare too, a 50% discount is significant given the price too.

>We think I've got undiagnosed ADHD, especially since our son has been diagnosed and I share a ton of the difficulties that he has, and cleaning doesn't really ring the dopamine bell for me.

I have a friend in a somewhat similar situation, although he was diagnosed earlier.  It's definitely worth talking to someone about, he's found at least some amount of help through tools he's learned.

I don't necessarily love cleaning as much as I enjoy having a monotonous productive task that I can turn my brain off for.  It gives me some sense of direction while I'm doing it while allowing me to space out with headphones on like you said!  

>That's not making it fair, it's getting revenge

I think you really hit the nail on the head here (and with that section).  So often when the situation is bad enough to warrant posting on the internet about it's probably so deeply inequitable it's hard to figure out what would actually be a better balance. Lol  nice one. Havent seen that for a while. Oh god I haaaaaaate that one. Thankfully the tides seem to have turned for the most part, and there tend be more folks debunking it rather than espousing it when someone brings it up. I think my most common removal personally is what I refer to as a 7-11 special. ""AITA because I am sad about my relationship"" basically. There's no interpersonal conflict and the entire post is just a rant about how dissatisfied someone is with their significant other. I can believe that. I have a feeling that whatever you do with contest mode though, the minute its over, the rankings of the top comments are not only set in stone, they will break away from the pack. The one in the lead will get further in the lead.

Until contest mode is over, its a bit of a lottery. I suppose it forces people to be more honest with their opinions. Not that honest though. I would be willing to bet that the very early posters (say the tenth) tend to scan the existing posts for a consensus before weighing in. Be either witty or angry and preempt the group-think seems to be a pretty optimal strategy from my observations Im not sure that doing anything with contest mode can do anything to mitigate the bad behaviour you describe. People are vindictive assholes and there isnt much anyone can do about that. The whole 'pile-on' mentality in here not only endemic, i have a sense its the main attraction for many. ... so is that a no?


I have never worked in a call center where they had us play word games on the phone, unless you count ""get them to say yes to increasing their cable package"" as a word game. I suppose there was the Ms. Jackson game some agents did, but that really wasn't endorsed by the managers at all. They absolutely are looking for a fight, looking to feel superior. It's like a form of mini-brigading. The game is afoot! Lol Eh, I'm still not personally okay with it. You do you, but I feel that normalizing downvotes just perpetuates the misuse. I understood that is what critical thinking involves.  I am asking why you think that happens here in judgements, especially unbiased judgements.. Its all just so dreary. Of the options you give, the sex act sounds best. In theory. In practice, its usually even more yawnsome.

At least make it interesting. ""AITA for splitting up because SO trained the Alsatian to work the video camera"". Now that sounds promising.

I guarantee that they would find a way to make something that sounds so interesting just as tawdry and pedestrian as every other break up post. It would turn out to be an argument about the various qualities of Canola oil or something equally tedious.

Not to mention the nauseating chorus of 'dont yuck their yum' replies. It might be a lack of imagination on my part - not being able to think of much that Florida Man would think twice before doing. 

I have similar rules, its just that story really does suggest that the sky is the limit. Oh man, you're missing out!  I started watching classic Mr. Rogers with my kids and he is just such a fantastic human being.  [Here's a video of him testifying before the senate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKy7ljRr0AA) that just showcases what he's amazing at. Just to add on to what techies said, Mr. Rogers was on the air for 30 years. There is a huge chunk of American kids who grew up in the 70's, 80's, and 90's for whom saying that would mean something. They might brush it off, but they would know exactly what it means. My hope is it would get through to them in a way calling them a fucking moron never would. I dont think mixing mayo, gelatin and hard drugs is a great idea. But maybe thats just me being old-fashioned.

Reminds me of a time someone dragged me to the Marijuana & Hemp Museum in Amsterdam. Most of it was a bit meh, but I found one part of it super-interesting: A cabinet full of ancient apothecary / pharmacy containers saying what was in the pot or jar.

The one I remember most was a foot powder, for which the ingredients were cocaine, cannabis oil and chloral hydrate. That presumably you were meant to rub on your feet. Wtf. I suppose its definitely going to do something. I dread to think what lol. Maybe good for dancing? Hey I get that!

I've been a big fan of broccoli roasted really hard recently.  Toss with olive oil salt and pepper and pop that in the oven at 500 for 20 minutes (preheat that baking sheet too) and it's fantastic.  I do the same with brussel sprouts and just can't get enough. lmao.  It made me realize that when I plant my garden this year I need to really go crazy with the asparagus.  It's one the few vegetables I know of that's a perennial where I'm at so I've just got to find a great out of the way spot for it to take over. I was TIL when I learned the ""Tiffany"" in Tiffany's table manners was *that* tiffany.  Huh, just no idea.

Yeah, breaking off the fibrous bit!  What I was referencing is there's a piece of advice handed down that you can know exactly how much of the bottom you need to break by holding you asparagus at the ends and just letting it break where it naturally wants to.  But really you just need to look and feel. I should have warned you: It may eat up big chunks of your time lol

They dont all have a proper conclusion, but many do. Yeah, there definitely are.  I think there's somewhere in the ballpark of 130 posts a day deleted after they respond to JB but before judgment is set.  That seems really high to me now that I type it, but I think the numbers I'm pulling it from are accurate.  

I also don't know what it looks like if they delete the post *after* we remove it.  It's possible that those appear as deleted too. > How many commenters do you think actually read the ""why OP thinks they are TA"" part?

What were you asking here then? Oh man, it's the exact opposite!  We fully understand our rules are stricter than many spaces online and it can be difficult to understand a small nuance of a rule that comes up.  But the only way to really get there is by explaining and that comes from users asking questions.

You wouldn't believe how often we remove stuff and say ""man, it's a shame they had to insult someone in the middle of that"" or just a simple ""they aren't wrong"".  We want that user to understand ours rules so they can resubmit their comment and get the valuable point across.

Our goal with moderation (especially around rule 1) is to have an objective standard that we can explain to anyone.  I certainly love to try.

Thanks again for asking the question and starting this discussion! I appreciate your response here. I completely understand you don't have time to handle interactions with kid gloves considering you have the volume of cases you do, which I wasn't aware of and assumed I was just being casually dismissed (which is incorrect).

Thanks for taking the time to elaborate. 

Also, I imagine most people who complain about bans are really assholes in their responses to you, so thank you for screenshotting my response to prove I wasn't being a dick lol. I understand your point of view and see where you're coming from.

I hope you can understand my point too, that I was civil and courteous and just expected the same back, but felt that wasn't the case.

You don't have to agree with me, but I don't think my point is invalid either. Participation in AITA in general. I took your comment about how AskHistorians uses verification to limit who's allowed to make top-level posts as advocating for a system like that here, so clearly I misunderstood that.

I fully get that there's pros to being able to see demographic data. A 35-year-old telling a 20-year-old ""this too shall pass"" hits different than a 16-year-old saying it, for instance. Similarly some advice seems wiser coming from someone with experience. The flipside of that is someone using a person's age against them in bad faith, though. There's enough instances of people trying to wave off the sub's opinions due to the demographics they think exist here without adding fuel to that fire. > I would absolutely value the opinion of someone aged verified 35 over someone unverified posting in the teenagers subreddit on about 95% of these posts.

But that too is problematic from my point of view. Age isnt a great indicator of anything by itself. 

A commonly brought up topic is marriage. Should you have been married to give credible advice about marriage? For how long?  Age doesnt tell us much about that. 

Childbirth / parenting. Ditto. How many kids should you have raised? Do you have to have given birth to comment on the process of giving birth? Are the infertile to be dissuaded from commenting? Again, age isnt the key thing here.

Those pieces of information are impossible to verify, but arguably far more important in context than age.  Also, how many other pieces of information would be required to take a view on whether someone is authoritative on any given subject? Age on its own is too many for reasons previously discussed. People will simply make this shit up.

And if we are to pick a single metric, age is just too blunt a measure for me. The old can be just as dumb as the young. Yeah both of those are straight up lies. Those comments are still in your history and even if you dirty delete, they can use the camas tool I shared below to find them.

I'm not discussing this further with you here. Bring it up in modmail like we asked. How did you find out about it last time?

Since your account was three days old and you tried to dodge the rules with the super clever ""b 1 t c h"" comment, I'll eat my hate if the ban evasion report on this account comes back negative. Why play dumb homie? I can understand that suggestion and where it's coming from.

From a moderator perspective we don't view this subreddit as an entertainment sub.  This is a service that we provide to people in need.  It's a space for people experiencing conflicts that want outside perspective and judgment on the actions they've taken within the conflict.

Pretty much every moderation decision we make is through that lens.

While I understand and appreciate that a lot of people get enjoyment from reading the stories here, that just isn't something we ever consider when deciding how to moderate this sub. Damn that sucks.  Sorry to hear that, but you seemed to have learned empathy and love so pass that on to the next generation.

My generation was raised to believe that homosexuality was bad and perverted, it took my parents longer to drop that BS then it did their kids, but we all moved on from the bigotry.  My parents died in the 90's but by that time they had left their hateful upbringing and realized love is love. >I wonder why they do that? Seems arbitrary at best.

Their subreddit has a rule that you can't talk about their sub anywhere on reddit.  If someone mentions the subreddit anywhere outside of the sub they ban them.  They actively choose not to set their sub to restricted or private (the built in features reddit has for just these sorts of situations) and instead want the benefit of a public subreddit without wanting anyone to talk about it.

They also report any comment that mentions their subreddit in any context anywhere on reddit and expect the other subreddits mod team to enforce *their* rules and remove that comment.  They'll follow up with a message to modmail if the comment isn't removed.  

We told them that while we will remove any and all comments that link to specific posts or comments or otherwise (directly or indirectly) encourage people to participate in their subreddit in bad faith we will not remove comments that simply mention the exitance of their subreddit. 

The comment that seemed to break the camels back was someone telling OP about this support subreddit they know about and encouraged OP to check out it because it might be valuable.  It was when we refused to remove that helpful comment they set up a bot that bans literally everyone that comments in this sub. Because AITA is a ""problematic"" sub that supposedly sends people to breakingmom to brigade there and, probably more important, didn't set up a bot to remove comments that mention their sub. I'm not guessing on this, either. If you look around at their rules/wiki/FAQ, it links to a page that discusses the various subs whose users are banned and why. Oh yeah, not being able to prevent people from seeing the subreddit via a ban is a good feature.  The limit to our control is not allowing participation on the sub because that's the thing that directly impacts the sub.  View it all you want though!

You're not alone in not realizing that either.  It's somewhat common to get messages from people asking to be banned because they don't want to be able to view the sub any more. u/Stoat_King used Sarcasm!

The move had had no effect.

(because tone doesn't carry well on the internet) We probably are. It's early and my brain has not wanted to kick into gear before 10am at all this week. Look, we're just not going to agree. It can be debunked - utilizing it in a medical environment is often harmful and arbitrary, the number doesn't correlate to anything consistently, so it's not a useful measurement. 

You're also wrong about the ""slightly obese is healthier"" studies so not sure what to tell you there. Researches have coined the the 'obesity paradox' but mostly because they can't fathom that there might be anything positive about being fat. This isn't comparing moderately obese people to underweight people, it's comparing them to ""healthy"" weighted people. 

I really really hate the idea that fat people are in denial about their being fat. Unless you're in their head you just can't make this claim. I have literally never met a fat person in my personal life or practice who is unaware of being fat - maybe it's just not a priority, maybe they feel hopeless about changing it - but the entire world reminds them they're fat every single day. I don't know where this theory about fat people all being massively in denial about their size comes from but it's real fucking stupid. All kids are entitled at some point, and so are most adults. Bullying doesn't teach them anything, it just entrenches any victim attitude, because now they actually are the victim. Kids are like that. No concept of who might be hearing while they talk about stuff they only half understand and all the nearby adults have a constant refrain of ""oh honey no, that's not how that works at all"" going through their heads. And of course you can't say anything because then you're the creepy adult who butts in on a conversation they really shouldn't have with someone else's kids, but you literally can't avoid hearing it. I'm glad that so far it's only been video game conversations I've overheard; I'm not looking forward to overhearing my kids' interest in dating when that starts up. I literally only go there for boneless skinless chicken thighs. Nowhere else has 5-lb packs of them for $2/lb I miss 3 am grocery shopping for the exact same reason. I do work from home, but my kids are tween-aged. All I really have to do when they're home from school is keep an ear out for fights and break them up. Work is still work, though, so it's still a bit of stress even when you've got your cats nearby and can eat all the good leftovers before anyone else has a chance.

>That's fantastic to have a parent able to help out childcare too, a 50% discount is significant given the price too

I think it lowered the cost to $400/week, which was still most of my paychecks at the time, but well worth it. I was able to stay in the workforce which eventually led to me getting a job that covers most of our bills with some left over.

> It's definitely worth talking to someone about

I've considered that, but it doesn't impact my day-to-day life too badly. I get the chores done that need to be done immediately, and the ones that can wait generally get done the next day. It does mean I have to take a step back and break work down into more manageable tasks or I start to distract myself by trying to jump ahead, but I've been dealing with my brain long enough that I've found ways to work around it.

>a monotonous productive task that I can turn my brain off for

That still doesn't draw me in, but chores are a great distraction when I'm mad. Go clean something and keep my hands busy while I work through my anger. It's way more productive than having an argument. It's even useful when I just want to tell someone who very stupid they are on AITA It gets brought up a lot in JustNoMIL. I have to be careful to phrase my corrections gently. >the minute its over, the rankings of the top comments are not only set in stone, they will break away from the pack.

Oh yeah, I think this is definitely the way it works.  It's just that without contest mode that starts immediately.  On all of reddit the earliest comments have a very significant impact on the direction of the conversation.  Contest mode at least creates some sort of buffer to allow a longer window for that initial conversation to happen.

Your later point feels accurate too.  I think there's going to be a point where contest mode has diminishing returns on time to the first comment. 

Last time around we had half of the data on length of the top comment and it seemed like a longer contest mode resulted in longer comments being the top comment.  If that also means a little more thought out comments going along with the length that's an interesting avenue to explore as well.

Do you have any thoughts on any other data points worth measuring would be?  (We've talked a few times over the years of trying out a longer contest mode and the consensus has seemed to be it's worth giving a shot and see how everyone feels about it.  We just never had anyone take the initiative to actually try it) I wish there was data on what percentage of flaired posts ends up with each judgement because it would tell me if I'm on track with this. My hope is that by extending contest mode, it does 2 things for ESH/NAH judgements. First, it makes them more visible as the randomization means that people don't have to scroll past the first few NTA/YTA judgements to find them. As the most popular judgements can often have very long threads attached, scrolling past to see other judgements can quickly become unpalatable. Second, it hides the voting which makes the pile-on effect less. I swear there are comments that only get downvoted to oblivion because they started getting downvoted. They're perfectly good judgements, but the first few people to come by didn't like them and put them into negative, after which they just attracted downvotes like shit attracts flies. By hiding the voting, it gets voted on merit and hopefully stands a better chance of not being downvoted to oblivion.

Maybe I'm overly optimistic here, but I see the potential upside of a limited-time contest mode as far outweighing the downside. No, none of this was endorsed by managers. Anyone caught doing it was pulled up for it so it was a risk as to whether that specific call was recorded. Honestly it was like working in a weird mix of a bank, a nursery and a zoo 😂 Foot-centered conflicts do seem to be one tell, at least at the moment The fact that the button is right there on every comment does more to normalize it than any opinion I might have on the matter. Its arguably Reddits defining feature. Its fundamental in giving reddit karma the illusion of being meaningful.

I do understand where you are coming from though. I am extremely irritated by the fact that you are getting downvoted for simply stating your opinion.

And it kinda proves your point IMO. Well, gotta look at the context and what I was replying to/referencing. 

Do I think judgements are made here with bias, yes! And that’s all good.


The person had said no critical thinking is used in response to someone saying they enjoy practicing their critical thinking skills. 

To be a good critical thinker and make a fair judgment with the information provided, you should try to set aside your own personal biases. 

That’s all lol 

But hell yeah people take on their own experiences to make a judgement or relate. Personally I'm on more of an avocado oil kick. Love that high smoke point.

Canola is good if I need to deep fry, though, just for the lower price. Hmm. I think i have been misinformed about Mr Rogers. Or completely uninformed.

Im in the UK and it just wasnt (and isnt) a thing. I only heard the name in the last couple of years.

Over here, kids tv was a bit - idiosyncratic. My favourite was Bagpuss. Wow I havent thought about that for a long time. I think that's you being modern rather than old fashioned 🤣

Wtf that foot thing though? Marijuana on your sweaty feet will definitely give an aromatic sensation I was never overly keen on brussels, and I'm not sure how the kids would feel about them. They always go for the broccoli, though. I've honestly had to tell my kids to eat the other stuff on their plates before they can have more broccoli. Agreed. And most people who cook know this. Perhaps this is a way of trying to make it easier for people who are new to cooking without using too many words! I was asking if anyone read it. You responded that it was bad. That wasn't the question. You could have just said no. Hey, I appreciate the response and conversation as well!

>Also, I imagine most people who complain about bans are really assholes in their responses to you

I might not go as far as most, but it's definitely many.  Part of that is not responding to the ban message is a reasonable route to take so we don't see all of those in modmail.  It's only a subset of banned users that respond and those that do skew towards folks that were deliberately malicious to earn the ban (which obviously your comment wasn't) so those are frequently the responses we get.

One of my absolute favorites was someone that told us to go fuck ourselves so we muted them.  After the mute they came back and got mad at as for not accepting the insults and responding professionally.  I wish I could find that chain because I *think* there was irony here as some amount of their prior warnings were calling people karens while they make these demands of the unpaid volunteers they insult.

Or literally just now someone came back asking to be unbanned.  When we banned them they sent us [this gem of a reply.](https://imgur.com/a/z4d2qox) which we appropriately archived and ignored as they asked.  We replied to their appeal with just a quote to that message.  They got big mad at us and told us that showing them their reply from two years ago was childish and immature. 

One of my favorite hobbies too is watching people talk about their bans and interactions then pulling up the receipts and seeing how much they differ.  It's always a pleasant surprise when it's like this where you were straightforward and honest about what happened.

I'm not sure I really have a point here other than sharing some of the fun interactions we get with those real assholes you described.  It also makes interactions like this and your original modmail a welcome break and downright enjoyable. I guess I don't see what the mods did as incivility,not as it's defined here nor as civility works IRL. You tried to open a debate, they said no. No one owes anyone else a debate, especially on positions that have already been explained and rationalized. Beyond that, there's nothing inherently uncivil with an emphatic no. If they'd cursed you out or mocked or insulted you, sure. That wouldn't be civil or okay, but literally all that happened is they said no in big letters. So while I can understand your point, I don't think it's really a valid one. I'm not sure why you are calling someone dumb who is trying to understand the rules. Is there like a comment on a comment or something in an inbox? I see I have a thing that says inbox but I noticed someone being rude to me in the comments and replied. The ~30 of you might not view this as an entertainment sub, but I'm sure the 3.6 million others might beg to differ. 

I'm kidding, I get your point. Ooh, your story gives me hope. And I hope that one day he accepts it too... That seems a little deranged. How odd! Hmm. I thought I was curious about the various subs and the why. It took me about 10 seconds to realise I was wrong. I would have thought there was an obvious strategy to adopt if 'not viewing the sub' was the desired result. Tbh I wasnt being sarcastic. I often think those things but dont bother posting such sentiments because there is no upside. Was just using them as examples of where adding extra verdicts might lead.

For extra lulz, we could let the people of AITA vote in the extra verdicts. I dont see what could possibly go wrong with that lol Apologies for not be clear. Is the opposite for me. Its been a long day looking at code written by an idiot. I know it was written by an idiot, because I am that idiot. I'm sorry if that came off as condescending, I really wasn't intending it that way.

It seemed from your initial comment that you're saying with certainty you know those posts were fake.  I'm just trying to explain that I don't have that same certainty about those specific posts being fake.

If I misunderstood the point you were making I'd love to correct that misunderstanding. >But I really really really do know what I am talking about here.

Lol you realize that on the internet, adding more 'really's doesnt convince anyone? Nor does it change the fact that redditors in general are not clairvoyant, or that noone is likely to care whether you have experience in these areas because such claims are unverifiable. 

Other people with similar experience to yours may recognize the shibboleths but otherwise you will effectively be talking a different language. 

I recognize very quickly people who profess to be experienced in my field. It is a small percentage of the people making such claims. ” I don't know where this theory about fat people all being massively in denial about their size“

I literally never said anything like this, and I don’t believe it. I do believe that a lot of “fat acceptance” and “healthy at any size” advocates are in denial about the health risks of being overweight. They know their size, but they pretend it’s healthy despite evidence to the contrary. 

You‘re right, we aren’t going to agree, and you aren’t even bothering to read what I say here, instead projecting and strawmanning. I have a sense that part of why they werent being quiet was to annoy the few adults there.

And it wasnt a case of 'thats not how it works'. It was EXACTLY how it works, just people are always to polite to spell it out lol.

Talking about dating, I remember when my daughter was  young I would wonder about how I would react to her first boyfriend. Turned out completely different to all the scenarios I had imagined. I have rarely felt more sorry for anyone. He was lucky she spat the bones out afterwards.

Their love lives are beyond my understanding now. I can't wait until mine get older and I can realistically do that!  Mine are fairly self entertained so there are plenty of times through the day they're just playing together without me needing to do anything.  But there's no rhyme or reason to when that happens so I can never rely on it for something planned.

>I was able to stay in the workforce which eventually led to me getting a job that covers most of our bills with some left over.

Yeah, I'm really feeling the impact of this now.  I definitely wanted to get out of sales as that was burning me out, but now that means getting the education to reenter the workforce is an extra step in the process and it's hard to find the time to get there.

I'm with you on rage cleaning too!  Last summer I weeded a giant flower bed in a few hours when ordinarily I would have spent a full weekend at it.  I was so exhausted I forgot why I was mad so it was a real win-win. As I mentioned to InterminableSnowman, I have only two issues about a longer contest mode: Difficulty of working out which posts I havent read and the ability to follow specific conversations in the thread. If only you could have a contest mode that hide the votes, but allowed chronological sorting, then I think a longer contest mode would have very few downsides. I certainly cant think of any.

Its interesting that doubling the contest mode length almost doubled the 'average time to top comment'. But to see what pattern really is there you would need at least a couple more data points and I dont think it would be worth the upheaval. 

I have a feeling that the law of diminishing returns would be less of a thing than one might expect. As soon as contest mode is over, regardless of anything to do with group-think, many are just going to read the top comment and vote / comment on that before reading further. 

Its a shame there arent more options.

If, for instance, the default view after contest mode was sorted by 'new', I bet that would make a difference. The effort involved in having the change the sorting to 'new' would in itself dilute the snowballing effect we currently see for the top comment. Seeing the most recent post first isnt 'as random' (lol) as contest mode but it would serve the same purpose. > I wish there was data on what percentage of flaired posts ends up with each judgement because it would tell me if I'm on track with this.

Phteven is going to make your day!  He's been tracking this alongside some other mostly mod related stats on a fantastic dashboard he built.  So we have the data we'll be able to compare if/when we try out a longer contest mode. Totally agree about the downvotes attracting more like flies on shit lol. 

I am interested in your point about having to scroll past the top comments with huge sprawling conversations nested within them.

I think part of it is laziness. The thread opens - you read the top comment first. Many, im sure, will just vote / comment on that and only look further if they are interested.

I have a sense that this very laziness would mean that if, for instance the default view after contest mode was over, was by newest, we would get a slightly different result. Instead of trawling through the top comment, people would effectively be reading a page of random opinions. And then they might sort by top, if they could be bothered. Personally I would sort by 'bottom' if I could. I am more interested in them. It bores the crap out of me paging down through thousand of posts.  

I wish there was functionality in place that allowed chronological sorting but hid the votes. It sounds like that would suit both of us. Chronological ordering is only really that useful for locating posts. I cant believe anyone really gives extra weight to early or late posts. They do seem to toe the line, but I've assumed they're nonfiction. If I'm wrong, I suppose I'll feel like a heel. But that's solely my problem. Lol. Im always bemused by those posts It's not just you, though. It's everyone. And yeah, the button needs to go away. Admins need to allow subs to completely turn off downvotes on a level that reaches all apps. But the biggest problem is the way downvotes are used, where a person can think they made a cogent point toast addresses the issue and gets pushed to the negatives because they dissented from the prevailing opinion. The mindset around downvotes doesn't go away if some subs don't have them; it just moves to the subs that keep them. Oh yeah, that makes sense.  Mr. Rogers being on PBS probably makes it a mostly American thing.  Mr. Rogers is just such a genuinely positive and kind person whose show significantly reflected that.  He's spoken of in much the same way Bob Ross and Steve Irwin are.

His philosophy when dealing with kinds and putting together his show are amazing and still one of the most valuable sources of parenting inspiration I have.  He treated children like people and respected them.  He validated their feelings and talked about what to do with those feelings.  He taught not to lie to kids and give them credit for being able to understand difficult concepts in an appropriate way.  I have his kids book on the death of a pet on my shelf for the moment we need to have that conversation with our kids rather than some ""she's off to live on a farm"" line.

On top of that he was just a genuinely positive and great person off the set too. I was never a fan growing up.  The only way I really like them is roasted hard at a really high heat.  When I want to make it more interesting I use bacon fat instead and reduce some balsamic vinegar to drizzle over top.  That's on my menu for tomorrow.

I love that you've had to have that conversation with your kids!  My kids haven't been big on broccoli and the only thing they like asparagus for is to play magic asparagus (it's from an episode of bluey).  But they both have eaten peppers like a hand fruit and the oldest will eat a full bag of steamed mixed vegetables in a sitting on top of the rest of a meal. You asked ""How many....""

I answered ""Very few...""

We're done here. Enjoy your day. /u/techiesgoboom has responded to me directly and cleared up the issue which I believe was the mods feeling I made ""offhanded comments"" and me feeling ""dismissed"". That wasn't the case from either side in the end and I feel validated by that discussion.

As far as I'm concerned this issue is over. Please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) to discuss your specific infractions further. Hey, I get it too!

Users finding this subreddit interesting is what draws participation, It's that participation and the comments you leave that actually serves the purpose of providing feedback to the people that post here.

If you didn't find this to a place worth visiting then it doesn't matter what we do for the OPs because there would be no one to answer.  There definitely is a balancing act here.  Rule 11 was in big part driven by feedback from users.

From a big picture view I just think we best achieve both goals best by not caring about making this subreddit popular.  We delisted ourselves from /all and completely ignore karma when we moderate.  We aim for consistency over individual outcomes.  Having that mission be the thing we design our moderation philosophy around really helps to maintain that level of consistency I think. Some of them make sense. I get that they probably don't want childfree folks coming in to say ""we'll maybe you shouldn't have had kids."" But some of those other ones seem like contrived excuses to try creating an embargo on various subreddits and probably forgetting that they're not that large a sub.

But y'know, it's whatever. I've spent more time and thought on them this afternoon than I probably should have, all things considered. But where did I suggest denial as a form of compassion? Please, quote that to me? Because maybe you're not reading it. It's fun to cherry pick fat acceptance people to uphold your argument - like any movement there's idiots on both sides. At its core, though, fat acceptance is needed and important! Oh man, I honestly cannot wait. I've found over the past few years that I really love messing around with data and this is data that I've thought about quite a lot without it ever being more than a nebulous cloud of question marks in my head. I don't think early comments get weight for being first, but by being first. It's a weird distinction, but it's basically the same as compound interest. If you have 2 comments of equal quality and the same opinion and 1 is posted an hour earlier that one will usually gather more votes than the other simply because it's had an additional hour for people to hit the button. Nothing can ever solve that problem. What contest mode does with randomizing comment order is it redistributes the voting a bit by ensuring people don't always see that one first. I likely agree more than it may seem. I think the downvote button is the source of a lot of the negativity in here and the primary motive force behind the group-think so endemic to reddit. 

I dont think hiding it is ever going to be an option though.

Moving it away from subs I frequent would be enough for me tbh so im not bothered it would just go elsewhere. And go it would. It seems to actively attract people. Well that makes a lot more sense of what InterminableSnowman was saying. I didnt mean it personally. I just meant that noone really believes anything on the internet. I couldnt care less about credibility - its all 'easy come, easy go' from my point of view.

I remember someone trying to convince a whole forum that they worked for NASA. The more they tried, the more people laughed. I wish I still had a record of the conversations involved. They were quite funny. As someone who often sorts by new and enjoys being the first to comment, I would say the low amount of coments then likely also adds to that.

An hour in there tend to be way more comments, I might read early on, but later I will check only top ones...

welp timer got to me again... could it be changed? I know Reddit lets you personalize the buttons so maybe it could morph into something else The mods have said that they could use CSS to hide the button, but that only matters for people viewing the site in a browser. Anyone accessing via a mobile app would still see that button and be able to use it. The only way to have it cascade to all platforms is to make it a site/subreddit option, and that's something the admins have declined to do."
tio99u,1647792218.0,2022-03-20,False,META,,techiesgoboom,So we decided to fuck with the sub... again.,"Greetings assholes and asshole enthusiasts!

[Two and a half years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cjresy/so_we_decided_to_fuck_with_the_sub/) we introduced our 1 hour timed contest mode on posts after [overwhelming support](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cnvolj/so_were_coming_in_for_round_2_of_fucking_with_the/) from the testing.  We thought now is as good a time as any to continue this testing and will be introducing a

##Two hour timed contest for the next week!

Back in the before times, before any timed contest mode, the top comment was posted an average of 4.47 minutes after the post was made.  That didn't seem like a good thing.  The impact early comments have in a post is a reddit wide phenomenon, but in a subreddit dedicated to proving valuable perspective to those that post here, users trying to be the quickest comment rather than the best just seems like a race to the bottom. 

We thought we could help decrease the advantage those very early comments had by setting posts to contest mode for a short time after posting.  Contest mode randomizes the order of the comments every time you open the comments section so there's an equal chance of seeing any comment made while the post is still in contest mode.

After testing, it turns out we were right!  With a 30 minute timed contest mode, this was bumped up to 6.82 minutes on average.  With a 1 hour contest mode, this went all the way up to 11 minutes during the testing.  We also had some data that the length of the top comment roughly *doubled* with a 1 hour contest mode!

At the time, we hadn't tested any further but have always wondered ""can an even longer contest mode do more good?""  Since this is the only way we know to learn that answer, we thought we'd finally perform those tests and see what happens.

###**What does this mean?**

For the next week, posts will now be in contest mode for the first 2 hours after they're posted.  

We'll be gathering data and listening to feedback on this change here.  Before the week is up, we'll reevaluate and decide where to go from there.",185,0.92,,2107,21,"Does this still mean only the top comment vote counts? I'm going to get downvoted for this (likely), but I'm very glad to see this.

On soooo many posts, the best and most thoughtful answers are at least several--and sometimes many--spots below the top comment, and some replies get as much or more reaction as do lower ranking, top level comments because soooo many people have jumped in to only reply to what became the top comment at the end of contest mode. 

Because those replies will often have more upvotes than the next leading top level comment, I suspect that people prefer to chime in to reply to the winning comment, rather than post their comment as a top level comment on the post, because they have a much better chance of gaining karma and getting interaction as a reply.

Very often the top comment is fun and pithy, but not actually great perspective on the conflict presented. There's alot of what basically amounts to ""NTA, I'm here for these petty revenge stories.""

I'll be very curious to see what results from this experiment. I'm going to predict that you also may see more commenters rising in the responder flairs/recognition ranks since more than just a few people will have a chance to get that ""first look"" exposure. I support it. Nice job, mods. I support this change. Just looking at posts it's pretty clear early posts have a distinct advantage Have you considered the probability that the earliest posts will always be seen by the most people because people who sort by new don't necessarily read every thread more than once, though? Nice Cool, love seeing you guys experiment with ways to make the threads better. Definitely NTA Has there ever been given any thought to be able to sort by type ie YTA/NTA etc?  I always think that’d be kinda interesting I LOVE this Will be interesting to see if 2h has as big an impact as 1h or if the effect plateaus rather quickly NTA. Cool! Since I only read AITA in the evenings, I’m often at a disadvantage when I post. Does the OP (in general) even read later posts? Nice! I was just dissecting this whole thing with someone yesterday (in a totally unrelated AITA post lol). So is it working here too. Uhhh nta. Boom! Downvotes pls I like this idea and would like to see that much further.
Because of the time shift lots of Redditors will never get to enjoy this feature, which sounds very reasonable. Contest mode is the most annoying """"""""feature"""""""" on this website Well shoot. Have tallying up the votes and deciding on the flair based whichever ruling has the most overall comments been tried? Sorry if that’s confusing idk how to word it. Idk if that’s something a bit could do or not. For determining the flair on the post: yes.  It's the way it's always been.  You can read more about why [in our FAQs here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_why_do_you_use_upvotes_to_determine_the_winning_judgment.3F_why_don.2019t_you_count_up_the_nta_and_yta_in_each_thread.3F) Oh absolutely that will always be the case to some degree.

The question is how much can we reduce that advantage early comments have.  We saw a significant reduction in that advantage with an hour of contest mode - more than half an hour did.  Now we're tracking the data to see what else we can do to reduce that.  But we'll never be able to eliminate it entirely. To sort the comments by type?  Unfortunately we don't really have the ability to do that. 

That would definitely be really interesting to be able to better find comments with different judgments though."
tikg9a,1647780948.0,2022-03-20,False,,,throwawaySarah7,AITA for getting mad at my husband because he laughed when I told him to reheat his own dinner?,"

For context_ I'm a sahm with 2 kids (3yrs old & 6months old) My husband is an ambulance driver, he works odd hours and comes home unexpectedly, he expects dinner or lunch ready whenever he gets home, whether I'm sleeping or busy with the kids. It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works.

After struggling with this for long, my mom suggested that I start pre-making meals so that dinner or lunch can be ready when he's home, all he's gotta do is just reheat it. I immediately got to it and went grocery shopping and spent an entire 2 days making meals and storing them in the fridge. His response to this idea is ""whatever"". I was sort of relieved cause now I could sleep properly, the kids care won't get interrupted etc.


Well, at 11pm last night, he comes home while I'm sleeping after putting the baby to sleep. I wake up to him shouting for me from the livingroom. I rush out and ask what was happening and he tells me he's hungry and wants dinner. I tell him it's in the fridge and just needs to be reheated and he didn't have to wake me up for it. He tells me I need to go reheat it for him. I say no, not happening and he needs to reheat his own dinner. He starts laughing sarcastically which got me mad. He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself, when I'm here and I can do it. I start arguing with him after he complains I'm not doing enough and refuse to reheat it then I go back inside the bedroom and shut the door.

He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point, I tell him he's being unreasonable to expect me to reheat his dinner when he could do it himself. He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out. This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.",14984,0.96,,1989,1884,"#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Please review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means. 

**Rule violations from this point will be met with a ban**. NTA and I’m so upset and angry on your behalf. 6 months means no sleep and broken nights, still being milk on tap, no clothes fitting still, and wild hormones. A 3 year old means getting no rest during the day even when the baby sleeps because 3 year olds +do not stop+. Both together means no privacy, no space, constant touch, constant shouting, and complete exhaustion. You’re doing amazingly to do what you have.

He is unreasonable. Utterly. This is not fair, healthy or good behaviour. It is utterly dismissive of what you’re doing, shows no care or consideration towards you and is completely selfish.

Depending on your relationship you could try and talk to him about how tired you are, what you do because he might not realise. If you’re more of a “show don’t tell” and can trust him to pull his finger out, go away for a weekend without the kids when he’s off so he can feel what it’s like and then have a talk. If neither of these are possible, then take the children and go and stay with your mother (or another family member) if possible. That’ll give you some space to work out what you want, and someone to help you so you’re not alone.

I’m so sorry he’s treating you like this, and congratulations on your baby. NTA and his response to you is deeply troubling/scary. Screaming and emotional manipulation is very abusive behavior. He's responsible for going to bed hungry, not you. He's responsible for ignoring your labor and that you also need sleep. I hope you have a good support network in place; his behavior is scary and you may want to have somewhere to go if it escalates and he doesn't get himself under control. Girl, I got news. You're in an abusive relationship.

NTA Oh honey. This is abuse. Please seek out support. Just because he isn’t hitting you doesn’t mean he is treating you appropriately. He is a full grown adult, and he can make and heat his own food. If he doesn’t like it he can move back in with his mother. I hope you make a plan and leave. OP

NTA

STOP 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

This is not about food

This is about control, this is about respect.

This is not something you're going to be able to handle on your own, you and your husband need neutral professional assistance to navigate this discussion.

The behavior your husband is demonstrating is absolutely atrocious, it is disrespectful and unloving.

What is your dynamic that he feels it's acceptable to be yelling where he could wake up children? And why does he feel it's acceptable to yell from a different room to wake you up? This is the behavior of a child not a full grown adult nor a respectful adult. If everything you said is true then I have to ask why are you in this relationship? He's yelling from another room throwing a hissy fit to wake everybody up in the house and get attention? Then he's punishing himself and won't eat in the name of being angry with you?

I do not recommend trying to have these conversations with him because you are both going to lose it, but if this is going to be a long-term permanent relationship for you you need help because this type of behavior does not improve on its own. NTA. OP.... You need to leave this man.

He has no regard for your well being or the work you do at home. And the waking you up to feed him dinner is straight out of the 1950s.

Talk to your mother. Make a plan, and get out of this relationship. It's only going to get worse as he becomes more selfish and entitled. NTAH and F*** him. He’s not helpless nor so exhausted that he can’t place a container in the microwave for two minutes. What a lazy bastard. Btw he is absolutely being abusive by screaming and waking you up knowing you have a 6th month old! 

I’m a police dispatcher so I know the long working hours, the crazy calls and the draining people/situations EMTs deal with- I totally get it. But & however there is ZERO excuse for his behavior. When he does this you remind him it’s not the 1950’s! You reheat your own Dam dinner  that I made while caring for OUR two children and a household! Period. He got you F’ed up if he thinks that he can just barge in like a caveman and demand dinner! No Sir!! Not happening! 

Good for you for standing up for yourself and I pray that his antiquated thinking was a one off but from you wrote you may have to check his ass more than once. The nerve of him! NTA. Little Lord Fauntleroy needs to pull his head out of his arse. He chose to go to bed hungry rather than use a microwave? And accuses you of trying to prove a point? 

I wouldn’t be cooking for him at all until he apologises. NTA. My 17 year old son just got a part time job after school. He regularly comes home around 8-9pm and reheats his dinner. 

This is a bigger issue than microwaving some food. NTA. Your husband needs to get his entitled ass checked out. Reheating some prepared food is not a chore and what's about ""working non stop an entire shift""??? That's literally the smallest amount of shift you can work non stop. I’m going to be straight with you. 

Reading your post gave me chills to my stomach and triggered me into what I thought was healed trauma. 

You’re NTA. Not even one tiny bit. You’re a GOOD woman. NTA, obviously. This is concerning, controlling, abusive behavior. OP I would take this as a moment to examine other aspects of your relationship and consider whether this is someone you really want a life with. NTA: tonight tell him to reheat last night's dinner first. You're a partner, not a servant. And he's treating you worse than a servant, they get time to sleep. NTA. Take your kids and ditch. Theres teenagers who go to school, work, come home, and make their own meals. If he can’t do it on his own he needs to learn how. NTA. What kind of person can't reheat their own dinner? It sounds like you're raising three kids. NTA. And I'd get a therapist. Or a good divorce lawyer. You're not a slave...sahm are still working full time (especially ones who are caring for infants without the help of their spouse) Nta.  I would actually be considering divorce bc his misogyny would be a deal breaker for me. NTA - what the hell is this shit??? I suggest he does a survey of his coworkers to find out how they eat their meals. The ones with partners probably do similar to what you did, have some leftovers in the fridge. The single ones - well god how can they possibly survive? I would love for them to find out and give him hell over it. I would also love for you to find a way out of your situation, but I know it can be hard as a SAHM. I’m so sorry OP. NTA you have a pathetic useless misogynistic husband NTA. He is a grown ass man with functioning arms and legs. Reheating your own food after work is called being an adult. Would he collapse from hunger and die if he was single? What did he do before you? Did you come along and save him from starvation? Tell him you aren't a stepford wife and he is a grown ass man. If he wants to keep treating you like this you will stop meal prepping for him and he can do the whole shebang all by himself You basically have 3 kids
NTA Wow, what a difficult chore. Putting a dish in the microwave, how could you do something so *cruel* to the center of the universe? ***Oh, the humanity!!***

NTA. As much as I understand how much nicer it is to have a freshly made meal, your husband was being a complete ass about it. Maybe if he'd gotten home 30 minutes after dinner, then he could ask you to reheat it for him while he changes/takes a shower or whatever. But to wake you up with such a silly demand? Incredible. I would've laughed back and said ""if you don't know how to use the microwave, just say that. We can call your mom and ask her."" NTA, ambulance drivers tend to spend a lot of their shifts just waiting. He can reheat his own food. Divorce him! NTA, I know this is a depressing response but I mean it in a realisation way. 

What would happen if you ended up in hospital unwell?

Would he go to bed unwell starving? Passing out. 

Does he take a private chef to work? Let me guess, you make him a packed lunch. NTA - did I just read what I did? Jeez. If my years of watching *911* and *Station 19* have taught me nothing else, that man is going to eat at the fire house while you sit at home with your guilt. NTA.  As I tell the members of my household-you have hands and brain; use them. Omg NTA. This so abusive. Please consider some time away from this situation to get some protection. You have been a baby making machine for the last few years and have been surviving but it’s time to put your self the future of your marriage in balance.  If your normalise his behaviour what’s next and what kind of punishment is next. NTA. Next time he says he’s going hungry and it’s your fault just laugh and say “suit yourself!”. Treat him like a spoiled child, when he gets hungry enough his ass will be heating his own shit up right quick.

Seriously though - are you and the kids safe? Like, is he violent with you? I’m worried about you op. Absolutely NTA... seems like there might be more going on here that may require some thought. Good luck OP, I hope this gets sorted out. NTA 

Why do his basic needs trump yours? You've already cooked a meal for him, if he can't put it in the microwave, he values this weird power trip he's on over your basic needs. You need to leave him OP as he clearly has 0 respect for you as a human. NTA, he’s a massive AH and I wonder whether this is the only thing he’s being such an abusive AH about. That level of entitlement rarely applies to just one area. NTA. He's a grown fucking man, and sounds like a real pathetic one at thst if he's using his job as leverage. Yeah, being an ambulance driver is tough, but exactly how much effort does it take to walk to the fridge, take out his food, walk to the microwave, shove it in, press a few buttons and just wait?

What a massive baby. If this is consistent behaviour, it's a massive red flag and you gotta run. NTA: run far far away from this man. He doesn’t respect you. You’re his live in maid, babysitter, and cook. I'm a SAHD.

Could you tell your husband something for me please?

""Thanks ever so much for all your hard work, I know it can be a terribly difficult job. Other than that, please kindly fuck right off.""

NTA. NTA

I’m an ambulance driver/EMT, and a police officer.

I refuse to let my wife get me anything once I manage to struggle my way out of all the crap I have to wear.

She just mommed two kids all day, she doesn’t need to mom me, I’m a big boy, expected to drive fast and safe and carry a pew pew.  He is a big boy too. NTA. He can go to bed hungry every night. How dare he expect you to wake up and serve him. NTA you need to evaluate your marriage. He is entitled and demanding,  did he expect you to feed him as well? Your husband is abusive NTA, that’s beyond ridiculous. He woke you up from your sleep to tell you to reheat something for him??? Does he immediately disintegrate if he steps foot in the kitchen or what? If I were you I’d tell somebody you trust what happened, because he’s being irrational and that can lead to a whole mess of issues. He doesn’t respect you, your time, or your efforts in your home. NTA is is an abusive, manipulative “partner”. I say “partner” sarcastically because he is not helping you in any way. You are doing all of the work while he expects it of you. This is not a partnership. Do you want your children to think this is how loved ones treat one another? They wake them up, belittle them, order them around? Please leave. Let him starve. I’m sorry what? His highness wakes you up to do this?? I’m married to a doctor who works weird shifts as well. Sometimes 20 hours straight. I leave a plate for him in the fridge and he heats it in the microwave. Your husband is a huge AH for throwing a tantrum. You aren’t his servant. NTA.

Get your ducks in a row. Get a job, find childcare, and come up with an exit plan. It's only going to get worse if you stay. NTA. If a grown man can't reheat his own dinner, then he's lacking some skills. I order cooked meals from a company called Mom's Meals and I literally just put them in the microwave. If your husband can't even do that, I can't see how your husband got through life. NTA

This made me so sad. I’m a mother and a wife and my husband would never. 

Your husband is abusing you honey. Please seek help. NTA. What is he? 3? Why does he need you to reheat something in the microwave, it literally takes no time and effort to do it by himself. NTA. A grown man can reheat his own meal. Concerning for you if he shows this behaviour elsewhere in your relationship, seems borderline abusive. NTA. I’m married to a first responder as well. I get the crazy scheduling and how hard that can be to get dinner done while also trying to settle a baby. When my husband comes home, if I haven’t gotten to cooking yet, he will start dinner and do the dishes. Your husband is a grown man who can work a microwave or pop things in the oven. What he’s doing is wrong and unfair - you need sleep and your children need your attention more than a whole ass adult does! His job doesn’t absolve him of the responsibility and ability to be an equal partner in your marriage. NTA. By the time you got to the living room, he could have been eating dinner. So if it wasn’t about timely food delivery, what was all the yelling about?

Control. Controlling you. Controlling when you sleep, controlling who is the center of your world. 

This whole spectacle probably reminds you of a tantrum your three year old threw, or the way your 6-month old needs attention and cries to get it. That’s because, emotionally speaking, your husband is about their age. 

I’m going to stop right now, and tell you to ask yourself this question: “Can I put up with this kind of crap for the rest of my life?” If you can’t, and you want to leave, do. If you don’t want to leave, I’d recommend reading the book “Disarming the Narcissist.”

Yes, this could be physically abusive in the future. NTA. All I’m hearing is your a SAHM with 3 kids. A microwaved dinner is a chore? Even my ass in the throws of depression could turn on the oven, throw food in and sit on the floor for it to heat. He woke up you so you could HEAT UP HIS DINNER!? I would tell him your inconvenience does not trump my needs. Your job is a SAHM, FULL TIME! I would ask him then when your break is if he gets a break from his job so should you. And if he balks I guess it’s time he knows just how much work it takes to run a house.

NTA and I’m fuming for you. NTA and your husband sucks.  You are also working a full time job taking care of the kids and are just as tired.  He’s the one trying to prove a point.  It would have taken him less time to heat up dinner himself than to argue with you about it.  The only reason he makes such a big deal out of it is because he feels entitled to use you as a personal maid. Leave before he gets home. 

The sarcastic laugh was step 1. 

He’ll hit/throw something near you before he actually hits you. 

By the time he hits you…. He would have broken more parts of you then you know 


Run.Now. NTA. I’d start packing my bags and leave before this abusive behavior escalates. Op leave him . This isn’t the 30’s or the 40’s or the 50’s you told your husband the plan this didn’t come out of left field if he had an issue he should have talked he choose to ignore it , also it literally take at most 5 minutes to reheat most meals your husband is a lazy pos Is he five years old? Because he whines and reasons like one. Sounds a lot like this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qjzhox/aita_for_dumping_my_husbands_dinner_instead_of/

Next time do as she did, and dump it in the trash  - along with your husband.
NTA Holy crap, NTA. What is he, 5? He can reheat his own food. I assume you have a microwave, but even if you don’t he can reheat it over the stove or in the oven.

Also people on this thread are right, this is super abusive and manipulative behavior. I’d run. NTA - you have kids sleeping and this guy comes in shouting his head off?

No, your a SAHM, you need your breaks and rest as well

He could easily have reheated his dinner, being the one working doesn’t Absolve him of needing to do things at home 

His attitude and the way he treats you are borderline abusive, the guilt tripping, the shouting etc NTA - he can die mad. I’m absolutely infuriated for you. I’m no ambulance driver but I’m medical and pulled 18 hour shifts two days in a row. And when I got home, I was grateful my husband had food for me and was *grateful* that all I had to do was reheat said food. To wake you up when you’ve cared for an infant and toddler all day is disrespectful and disgraceful. NTA NTA. Your husband is a dickhead. As others have said, this is a red flag. Whilst it may seem crazy to end a relationship for one argument over reheating a meal, this kind of behaviour can be where more abusive traits start.
I would be having a long hard think about my relationship and also making a few plans to cover myself if I ever needed to escape at short notice.
Whilst I don't usually think that people should broadcast their relationship issues to family members, this is one which I think you should discuss with a trusted family member. Keep them in the loop of anything that seems 'off'.
Good luck OP, and I hope that this was just a one off stupid reaction from an overtired, stressed, husband and not the start of something more serious x NTA You’re not his servant. This is abusive OP. I am a SAHM of 2 kids also. This isn’t right. He is a grown man and capable of feeding himself. You making the meals ahead of time was extremely kind. Don’t let this man abuse you, you don’t deserve it. NTA…. Oh my god is he 10?! Jesus NTA and your husband sucks.  You are also working a full time job taking care of the kids and are just as tired.  He’s the one trying to prove a point.  It would have taken him less time to heat up dinner himself than to argue with you about it.  The only reason he makes such a big deal out of it is because he feels entitled to use you as a personal maid. NTA and I'm sorry that you even need to ask. Are you partners or master and servant? He needs to get his head straight or you need to reconsider this marriage: what are you getting from it? NTA. Sorry that you have three babies to deal with Nta- why do you even love this man? Are you his maid or his wife? You put your foot down now don’t pick it back up! Well then I guess he's going to have to get used to being hungry.

NTA. He works 12 hours in a day. You are a SAHM and work 24. He's not a baby. Tell him to start pulling his weight. I would leave tbh NTA

Hate to break it to you, but you don't have 2 children you have 3. NTA. 

What kind of partnership is this? When does your shift end and you get waited on hand and foot? Caring for a three year old and six month old is absolutely gruelling work even when both partners support each other. 

I’d go on strike. Look after the kids and yourself and leave everything else you did for him. My god, he needs to realise the bulk of the work is on you. You are providing the free labour to support him work and be a father. Fathering your kids is not some favour he did you. Is he wants a family, then he must participate. 

Don’t stay with a man that doesn’t appreciate you and the lion share of labour you provide by raising the kids -and I’m not even talking about the waiting on him hand and foot, that should stop right now. Utterly unfair. NTA husband is an entitled jackass and you aren’t a slave- how dare he wake you up like that? Why does he think it’s acceptable? Laugh back as you starve him out see who cracks first. NTA. Good grief, my 12 year old can put food in a microwave. Your husband is TA. You have been working all day looking after the kids and you’ve spent all that time cooking. NTA - he’s being manipulative and abusive here. You both work HARD and irregular hours. SAHPs are working a more than full time job, one that, when we do the math, would be a 6-figure expense if you hired people to replace them. 

Honestly, if this man is going to weaponize his incompetence and behave like this, you need either couples therapy or a divorce. This behaviour is FAR from okay. NTA.  Not all abuse is hitting. This man has no respect for you and treats you like a slave.  You deserve better.  

Does he control all the finances?  Do you have a support system if you need to leave? I'd be curious to know what he would say if you reminded him it was his mum's advice. 

Anyway it has nothing to do with his job - he'd be demanding the same thing if he had a 9 to 5 office job. He's the AH.


Edit: Misread the post - it was HER mother's idea. NTA.

Isn't intentionally disrupting a partner's sleep also a sign of abuse? 🤔 NTA and he sound potentially abusive if he treats you with this little respect and have no problem waking up the whole house when he get home. Sorry to say it but you should probably take a very hard look at how he treats you and think about saving up and ways to care for yourself financially so you can leave him because he doesn't sound like a partner, he sounds like a master talking to his servant NTA

he should do the bare minimum of heating his dinner. He a grown man and drives an ambulance he knows he’s not pass out. He needs to stop being your 3rd child and heat his own food. What sides he think single men do,starve to death. Pfft. I’ve worked 24 hour shifts before and if I was hungry I’d make my own damn food. I never demanded my wife make it for me. NTA He's an ambulance driver and I'm going to assume knows basic health facts such as not passing out from hunger when he had breakfast and lunch.  And the gaslighting!  He went to bed hungry due to his own misogynistic self.  You are NTA in any way. NTA. He is controlling. You have 2 kids, you sah, he thinks he has you trapped. Plan on going to work as soon as possible, put money aside, have a bail out plan even if you never use it. NTA but you may have married an actual child or possibly a small rodent This is abuse. He is cruel. He is an abuser.

No sane person wakes their spouse late at night to serve them a meal. None! He knows it and you know it. And to shout out loud to wake you, knowing it could disturb the kids too, after which no doubt he would go to bed and leave you to settle them - well that’s scary and evil….. 

You also work - all day, looking after an infant and a toddler. If you had to pay someone to do what you do, so he could walk in and out as he pleases and demand food at random timeframes, then it would cost him a fortune! 

Get out now or set him right - give him a timeframe and stick to your guns.

NTA. Yeah, he can get used to cold food then. You yourself might want to get used to the idea you're in an abusive relationship and start thinking about exit strategies. This is not normal behaviour. NTA. NTA. He is being ridiculous. My husband works 12 hour shifts, overnights. When he comes home in the morning, he gets his meal prep, pops it in the microwave and eats it. If he wants eggs or something else, he cooks it himself. Hell, there are times he comes home with breakfast for both of us. My point is, he's a grown up, he makes sure he's fed.

You are NTA, but something has to give here. It can't be put all on you. Does he work odd, long hours? Yes, but SO DO YOU! I have a 6 month old, they are a lot of work, and you get no days off, I'm assuming when baby is sleeping you're taking care of the house.

Next time he has a day off, why don't you leave for 12 hours, then come home yelling about how hungry you are? Divorce him Just the fact that he laughed and completely disregarded the work you put into making the meals shows you your place in this marriage. Does he want you to sit down and feed him too? I would seriously rethink my future with this man. Or better yet with this spoiled child. Ask yourself this - do you really have time to raise THREE children? You’re taking care of a three year old and an infant 100% by yourself, which is nuts even if he is the one working outside the home. He should be helping YOU. NTA 

Please find a job and leave this abusive dude. NTA. Even if you were without kids is unreasonable that he wakes you to make food. Looking after two young kids and I assume the household is NOWHERE close to being easy.
He fully sat there for an hour after you told him to heat it up and still went to bed hungry because YOU'RE trying to prove a point? Yells at you from the living room to wake up rather than gently walking you up?

How many red flags do we need?
This man needs talking to about the facts of life. NTA If a grown man can’t understand that being a SAHM is a full time job and making dinner isn’t even in that job description than he can take his job and hunger and go do whatever. You don’ have to be with a man who doesn’t respect you, your job, your effort or your sacrifices. Don’t put up with his shit. What he did is straight up abuse Does he also expect you to wipe his ass? I mean seriously, he could put dinner in the oven while he takes a shower and it'll be done by the time he gets out. It takes all of 30 seconds. He's lucky you prepared the meals for him. Definitely NTA. nta i would pack his bags an kick him out for being a control freak. NTA at all. I used to jokingly complain when I would miss dinner due to work when I was a teenager. It was easy enough to get the leftovers out and reheat them, but my mom started packaging them in the plastic chinese take-out containers and all I had to do was throw it in the microwave, didn't have to put anything together. It was the absolute best and so easy! Your husband is being so lazy its unbelievable! NTA, does he not know that raising your two kids is a massive job ?? NTA.. Wahhhh.. What a big baby your husband is. Fuck that.. He'd go hungry. NTA what is he 12?? ""I'm going to sleep hungry and it's your fault"" if he's really that hungry he can heat up his own food NTA

Op- y’all need to have a serious discussion about this. He needs to apologize for treating you like nothing more than a servant basically. I won’t say leave him cause there’s not enough information to do so, but proceed with your marriage with extreme caution. NTA. I ask you really consider about leaving him or give him an ultimatum. He doesn't respect you. Yes he might work hard, but you do too. You might be just a sahm but that's also one of the hardest jobs there is. You need to realize you have a hard job too and you're basically doing it by yourself because judging by his behavior he's not putting any effort into being a husband and maybe even a father.

Learn to respect yourself more, and if he can't learn to respect you, then leave. You were not put on this earth just to cater to his every need. NTA. Your husband is one for sure. NTA

Honey that's abuse. There's no reason to scream nor is there any reason he can't rehear his food 

Please leave. Oh my god this made me really mad. That man can't take a container from the fridge, put it in the microwave, start it and then take it out???????? NTA and leave him! You misspelled ""3 kids"". NTA NTA, hun

My husband has faults, but the man *would never* wake me up to make him food. I have been a SAHM for 6 years. He works a very labor intensive and high stress job and could come home on schedule or could be 4 hours later after we've gone to bed. If he comes home and I'm asleep, the man gives me a kiss and lets me know he's home, then goes about his own shit. 

The majority of the time I will plate his dinner and leave it in the fridge. He has never asked me to do this, I just know he's tired and it helps him. But do you want to know what he does if I don't? *He makes his own plate* Do you want to know what he does if I didn't even make dinner? *HE FIGURES IT THE FUCK OUT LIKE A GROWN MAN*

Your husband is abusive at worst and stupid at best. NTA. Divorce him. Oh honey no. His response is unacceptable. NTA. NTA

MAYBE coming home at 5p / 6p but not 11pm (I said MAYBE).  I mean I would text you, telling you I would be home at 6pm if you have not eaten but I would expect you and the kids to be asleep at 11pm and I would not want to wake anyone up - but that is just me.  

Things are changing - he got used to a hot meal before the kids.  But now you have a lot more to do - he needs to respect that.  

And since he is an ambulance driver, he needs to turn his phone on - he probably has heard a lot in his profession and needs to realize he is a husband and father that has responsibilities. Face it. You have THREE kids not two. He is a manipulator and an abuser. You do not give in on this issue. If he fights you on this (and he will press it as far as he can) get your mother's help and leave him (even if it's temporary) to let him know you will not budge. Would it help to get his mother involved also? I wonder because he had to have learned this behavior from somewhere. NTA

My mom's a first responder (RN) and we usually prep meals and stuff 24 hrs in advance. If she got home and we were sleeping or busy, she'd heat it up herself. The audacity of people. NTA. He’s an asshole. Don’t even spend one more minute going back and forth about this. He’s a grown man. An 8 year old can use a microwave. Ha! NTA. Let him know my first responder husband cookers dinner for our entire family (5 people) after his shifts sometimes, also helps with the baby at night and takes care of the kids during the day so I can go out alone! Sometimes he doesn’t get a single minute of sleep in 24 hours and he will still cook food, take the kids to school. Etc. your husband is cruel and abusive and lazy and childish.

ETA: I don’t force him to do these things either. He wants to, he enjoys being a supportive person who his kids will see as a loving and kind person. Your kids are certainly picking up on this behavior, or they absolutely will soon enough. Can you imagine either one of them treating their partner this way, or being treated this way? Yikes. NTA. Definitely NTA, he can go hungry if he wants. That's his choice, don't reheat nothing!! NTA. 

He’s horrible though. Remind him that if he were single, he’d still be working, then he’d be coming home to cook his own food and do his own chores (if you can safely, he honestly sounds abusive). NTA. You’re in a toxic relationship. Time to leave, you can do better alone. NTA. Oh yeah because you don’t have your hands full all day everyday. I’m sure he is real helpful when he is home too. Hahaha he can warm his own meal in the microwave. He’s starving himself. Let him starve. Maybe he should start cooking his own meals too!! Your husband is being ridiculous, don’t be his slave, that’s how’s he treating you Sounds to me like he is a classic narcissist, you are defo NTA Edit: I am getting a lot of comments saying that this advice is too blunt because the situation is abusive. OP, judge your safety and decide what's best for you. 

NTA. Here's a script if you want to use it: 

""Hey husband, we need to talk about what happened last night. I have a few things to say and I don't want to be interrupted.

""From now on you will sort out your own meals. I will not be lifting a finger to sort out breakfast, lunch or dinner. You are a grown man and you will do it yourself. Especially after how you treated me. I will not be changing my mind. 

""Secondly, you will be doing your fair share of work around the house. You live here too and looking after two young children is not a holiday. You will have to do chores. I am happy to do most, but not all. 

""Thirdly, I need an apology from you for yelling at me and waking me up purely to put your food in the microwave. This was absolutely disgusting behavior from you and we're not moving on from this unless you realize this and apologize."" 

And yes, threaten to leave him. Save your ""oMg ReDdiT aNd dIvOrCe"" comments. I don't care. Ywbta if you stay. You are definitely NTA but your husband is an AH and a whiny baby. I make my partner dinner whenever I make myself something (which is normally around 7pm) even though he works overnight and doesn’t get home before 3am normally. He has never woken me up for food even when I don’t feel like making dinner, and he just heats up whatever I left him. It makes absolutely no sense why he’s ruining your sleep and being a huge baby acting like he can’t use a microwave, and he’ll die waiting the two minutes it takes to heat it up. You are busy enough with the babies and the house. He can feed himself. NTA. He doesn't respect you and how hard it is to be a SAHM. Honestly, the deep rooted misogyny in him will not be gone from one day to another. 

So sadly, you either have to work really hard to be respected by him, but I think it's rather hopeless. So please go look after yourself and especially after your children because he will not treat them with respect either and he may even be a bad role model for them. NTA He may work hard and having odd shifts is difficult to manage; however, you are working hard at home, too, and unpaid. He is a member of your home, a parent to your children, and a partner to you. Despite his outside job, he still holds a responsibility to help at home. The least of which is to figure out how to feed himself. The fact he woke you, spoke to you in a condescending manner, and acted fully entitled to something he can do himself makes me ragey. Also, if I were your mom, I would tell you he can figure out how to cook his own damn meals, not how to make it easier for him.

 Question: does he help parent, too, or does he consider that a chore as well? NTA. You also work hard all day. I can’t believe he woke you up to heat up his food like he’s a baby. Maybe he needs to go stay at his mommy’s house since he needs so much. You keep three kids happy and healthy all day, you work just as hard, you just don’t get a paycheck. I’d personally be done cooking for him. Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I  ight be ta for refusing to reheat his dinner since I was already up and picking a fight with him and being kind of stubborn. But I think that since dinner was already made by me then all he could have done was reheat it.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.* NTA. Raising kids is a full time job! You don't get a break ever, you are on call 24/7. When he gets home he can make his own meal. NTA. Drop his ass NTA, your husband is a big a$$ jerk. I myself used to work as a paramedic. I had the odd hours as well as 24 hour shifts. Either I took food with me to work or bought fast food. In the rare chance I got to stop at home. I never expected my wife to have food waiting for me. I was in, got what I wanted, made enough if my partner wanted something. Kissed my wife and was back out the door into the ambulance and we were on our way. Never once did I expect anything while I was at work. Give your husband a swift kick in the butt. If he keeps the attitude up, let fend for himself a bit and remember what the single life is like. Or let him handle the kids after work give him a taste of his own medicine. NTA okay so your partner regressed to toddler stage... please dont reheat it for him 
Also shouting from other room..
If his job makes him stop being a normal human being he should change careers. NTA leave his ass already jesus christ NTA. If he was alone and had no other choice, he’d be more than happy that a meal was already prepared and he didn’t have to make it. If you were working too, and your child was in child care, like many people have to do - he would heat up his own meal. That being said, People treat you how you allow them. At some point along the way, he got used to being spoilt so bad that he feels it’s ok to call on you like Cinderella. He learnt his lesson from you today, you’re not going to wake up to heat a meal. You’re setting boundaries and that’s good. Don’t let his anger or actions make you back down. His request was in fact unreasonable therefore you have every reason to ignore his mantrum. He sounds stubborn so you may have to initiate a sit-down to come up with a compromise resolution for the future. NTA. like how he had the energy to argue but using a microwave is too much work for him Honey, you are being abused. NTA but you are if you stay with this child Nta. Tell him that he is an adult, and you are not his mother. He is a grown ass man and unless his hands are broken he can reheat his own dinner. Unless he feels like breaking his hands, he can grow up and do it himself. And if he feels like reheating his own dinner is a chore, then that's his own problem. Seems like eating is not that important to him. And if he almost passed out from Hunger, because he refuses to reheat his own food, then that is also his own problem. NTA. Your husband is acting like a child and you both should work on straightening out that behavior at once. Don’t give in. Not an inch.

That being said…

Search within yourself whether this is a solitary flaw in his character or a sign of worse things to come. But do it yourself. With your full knowledge of how he is.

Don’t just blindly listen to a lot of the commenters on this sub, who think the only solution to a marital dispute is divorce.

Edit: grammar I’m stunned a grown ass man actually said those things with a straight face.  Fucking abusive tool bag.  NTA

What on Earth does he think he’s teaching his children acting like this??? I’m going to use the name in your throwaway. 

Sarah, honey, you deserve so much more. This man is SCARY. You may not be able to see it now because you’ve been worn down by his abuse. I know, I’ve been there. This man doesn’t care about his kids. He doesn’t care about his wife. He only cares about himself. He is not a partner; he doesn’t support you at all, in any way. He will not help parent those precious babies in any meaningful way. Please, please leave. You are not meant to be made so small as to just be a housekeeper and guardian of Littles. You are a human being, a real person, and should be treated and valued as such. 

Leave. Now. It will only make you smaller and get worse, and your children deserve better. They deserve to see their mother receive better. It will harm them in so many ways if you stay. Will it be scary? Of course. Will it be hard? Definitely. But this is not sustainable. This is dangerous. 

Definitely NTA. Not in any shape or form, except if you stay with this man. My husband is a firefighter/paramedic and would NEVER treat me this way. NTA. Also, one thing I did not realize was how much trauma my husband was experiencing on the job. Does he have someone to talk to about this? Maybe he needs some therapy to help him deal with his job? Just a thought. NTA and please divorce him, he clearly doesn't respect you and your kids. NTA. Honestly, you gotta leave this guy - this kind of mentality just doesn’t change no matter the therapy. Save yourself and your kids from this guy, because this is no way to be treated. Stories like these fuel my childfree life style. NTA. You are being abused. The expectations he has placed on you is not normal or healthy. Remind yourself & him he’s a GROWN man & you take care of THREE kids all day. The LEAST he could do is eat what you cook. And I mean that’s the LEAST. He should be cooking & cleaning. You’re raising 2 tiny humans. If you don’t seek therapy or have a serious talk with him- YTA to yourself. NTA but it sounds like that there are larger issues here if your husband gets so worked up over not wanting to take five minutes to heat up leftovers that he’d rather go to bed hungry. ^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For context_ I'm a shame with 2 kids (3yrs old & 6months old) My husband is an ambulance driver, he works odd hours and comes home unexpectedly, he expects dinner or lunch ready whenever he gets home, whether I'm sleeping or busy with the kids. I do it because I know how hard he works.

After struggling with this for long, my mom suggested that I started pre-make meals so that dinner or lunch can be ready when he's home, all he's gotta do is just reheat it. I immediately got to it and went grocery shopping and spent an entire 2 days making,ING meals and storing them in the fridge. His response to this idea is ""whatever"". I was sort of relieved cause now I could sleep properly, the kids care won't get interrupted etc.


Well, at 11pm last night, he comes while I' sleeping after putting the baby to sleep. I wake to him shouting for me from the livingroom. I rush out and ask what was happening and he tells me he's hungry and wants dinner. I tell him it's in the fridge and just needs to be reheated and he didn't have to wake me up for it. He tells me I need to go reheat it for him. I say no, not happening and he needs to reheat his own dinner. He starts laughing sarcastically which got me mad. He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that afterworking no stop fir an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself when I'm here and I can do it. I start arguing with him and refuse to reheat it then I go back inside the bedroom and shut the door.

He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point, I tell him he's being unreasonable to expect me to reheat his dinner when he could do it himself. He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out. This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.* I feel like I’ve read this before - can anyone link? Might have useful info. Red Flag!!! Get out of there! He’s gaslighting!! A microwave isn’t rocket science… Being a stay at home mom does not make you a servant/slave to him. This is not OK and your husband is mistreating you. NTA.  He’s abusive.  Take the kids and leave. NTA but this is a very clear cut sign of the beginnings of an abusive relationship. What kind of partner demands control like this? An abusive one. You are working all day. How is he helping with that??? The lack of respesct, empathy and love towards you is dumbfounding.

He is being unreasonable and abusive. Honestly his behaviour made my blood boil. Let him starve if he won't heat up his meals himself.

NTA

ps: your mom's idea was great.  very practical and you get to have some time to rest uninterrupted. NTA

That laugh scares me. My ex did the same to me before he got violent. I know you won’t believe me but get a bag packed. Put your kids’ things at your mom’s or a storage unit. Get out before you get hurt. 

He woke you up to bully you bc he won’t touch a microwave, an air fryer, or a stove. That shows zero respect to you and zero care for your needs. You already bend over backwards by the meal prep. Let him make a sandwich next time. Definitely find a way out safely. Therapy will show you your strength. NTA starving instead of reheating food is pure manipulation, same type of person will threaten to take their own life if you leave. NTA - I was first a little offended by the term “ambulance driver” since the job is a lot more than being a taxi 

BUT obviously he’s being incredibly unreasonable. I work 12s and have no problem cooking myself a meal after. Reheating a pre made dinner would be amazing! That’s really nice of you to cook for him. 

His reaction was awful, childish, abusive. He doesn’t sound worthy of your love and care. No words..... Another day, another AITA post that proves I'm right that women should not agree to be stay at home parents because their husbands will consider them to be slaves As a former bully this is nothing but a bulky tactic YTA to yourself. He has no respect for you. You spent two days preparing food for him, which you didn’t have to do AT ALL, but he’s mad he can’t get his jollies tormenting you into serving him. Please, get yourself a good lawyer. Maybe move in with your parents with the kids or get a job so you can afford your own place, but get the fuck away from this guy.

You are NTA, you are the victim of psychological terror. HOLY COW MAMA! NTA!

So you basically have a third child when he is home? Does he do anything for you when he is off work ? And calling you petty for making a point and going back to bed makes him the biggest loser I’ve seen in a long time !! He’s a grown ass man capable of saving lives and he refuses to push a button to eat ? He can eat cold food for all I care he’s a snob and you are NOT HIS MAID/DOORMAT 
Damn I gotta pick my jaw up off the floor now! NTA. He’s treating you like a servant and he’s abusing you. NTA. You have a full time stressful job with long hours, too: it’s called being a sahm to two young children. He can heat up his own damn dinner. NTA. You need to have a talk with him about how abusive it is to wake you up to reheat food for him. When he comes home from a shift, his work is done. Your work is 24/7, you don't need the pressure of a 3rd child on top of that. NTA - tell him to get a grip or GTFO. Your time, healthy and sleep are just as valuable as anyone else. You are both PARTNERS. You’re not his servant. NTA

How else is your husband abusive? 

You work all day. If he had a regular arrival time then making dinner for around then would be fair. But he doesn’t. He works weird hours due to the nature of his work. 

If he wants a freshly made to order meal then he will need to order himself takeout. 

Your accommodation is normal. You are literally caring for children and have to work with THEIR schedule - this means sleeping during their sleep schedule too. Waking up at 11pm to cook a meal is absolutely ridiculous. 

Let him have his tantrum. Don’t cave. His food is sitting there in the fridge and he is able to eat it whenever he wants - but YOU already did your share of getting it prepared and ready for him. My partner physically *cannot* stand long enough to cook dinner due to a brain injury acquired in November. 

He sways and falls if he stands for too long. 

It's devastating to him as he hates not being able to do anything to help me. 

I get up to meal prep every morning before work, wrap his meal and leave it either on the counter or in the microwave. 

OP, my partner has literal brain damage and mobility issues, and he can whack a fucking plate in the microwave for 3 minutes. 

NTA, and if your partner keeps being s jerk about this, suggest to him that he's always welcome to make a sandwich instead of heating up a meal for himself. NTA he is being abusive and his turning the phone of is immature and gross, bleh NTA, what an asshole of a husband. He went to bed hungry because he couldn't be bothered to reheat his own meal, not because of you.
You spent 2 days preparing his meals and he was an inconsiderate ass by waking you up when you spent the whole day taking care of kids which is way worse than working in an ambulance as a SAHM, your shifts are way longer than his. he needs to grow tf up because heating your own food up is not a chore. does he expect you to spoon feed him too?
NTA The boy refused to spend a minute and half heating something up and instead went to be hungry of his own accord? Yeah, stand your ground here. You made him dinner, he can. Act like an elementary child and heat up his meal or he can act like a toddler that didn’t get the cookie they wanted. Nta If my husband did this to me , I would reheat that food and then throw it in his face ! How the hell  can you accept this treatment ? Are you his slave ? NTA. This man is controlling. Do you want your kids to learn that it’s okay to treat their spouse like that? He deliberately hurt himself (didn’t eat) to spite you. Ambulance drivers honestly don’t get paid that much. Offer to get your own job and he can pick up basically being a slave. He knows it’s not right to wake someone up (especially the way he did) just to force them to heat up his food. He does it because he wants to prove he’s the master of the house and has control over the family. Be careful O\_O.

Run.

No, seriously, I'm sorry, you may or may not love this man deeply, but either way I'd recommend trying to get out of this toxic relationship. You can try couple counseling, but I doubt that's going to work. Your husband, a grown man, is pretending he cannot hit two buttons and wait five minutes and then has the nerve to try to guild-trip you over not doing it for him. In doing so, he's completely disprespecting you and failing to show appreciation for all the work *you* are doing. No matter how you slice it, that's some serious toxic behavior. OP I'm really concerned for you.

First, you are NTA in any way, shape, or form.

Second, this post seems to be full of huge red flags for an abusive spouse. This is about control, not respect. I'm concerned for your safety. Please do whatever you need to stay safe. INFO: how does he work as a paramedic without his hands? I assume he doesn't have any hands himself and that's why he needs to be served hand and foot when he's home. 

seriously, you are in an abusive relationship. you will deny it for a while, and brush off all the comments on here. but there's a voice nagging in the back of your mind that this isn't right. News flash, most people are not treated this way. it's possible to have a partner that doesn't treat you like a servant. you can survive with your two kids without him. I hope you one day get the courage to try. When I was a teen, my mum (single parent) worked late shifts so wouldn’t be home until well after dinner. There was always a cooked meal ready for me in the fridge/microwave when I got home from school. If a thirteen year old can operate a microwave and be damn grateful for the thought and the effort, a grown man can do so, without abusing his wife.

Please reevaluate this relationship OP.

I’m so proud of you for standing your ground and not giving in to his ridiculous demands. 
I guarantee you will have worked harder than him in the previous 15 hours looking after the kids - including a baby - the house and everything else being a SAHM involves. 
For him to come in demanding you heat up a meal you have spent 2 days preparing is absolutely not ok. 
It doesn’t sound like he cares about you as much as he cares about himself and that should be the basis of any marriage. NTA

He's out of his mind expecting you to function on his schedule. You made him food, he can operate a microwave.

Going to bed hungry and blaming you, that's abusive. Take your kids and leave. NTA!!! My wife used to work overnight (7pm - 7am) shifts at the hospital while I worked normal days. Sometimes I’d have the time/energy to make her a nice dinner before she left or breakfast when she got home. If I wasn’t home or was otherwise busy with something, I’d giver her a heads up that she needed to plan to prepare a meal and - as a functioning adult - she would do it, no arguments or complaints. 
Your husband works weird hours - you WORK as a stay at home mom keeping the house together. This is about respect and control and he has NO respect for you but thinks he should have COMPLETE control. And that is not healthy!!! Respect of each other’s time and ability to do something is paramount. He clearly has no respect for you or your need to rest/recover after caring for your young - and very needy at that age - kids ALL day. The only way you would be the AH is if you stayed with him and allowed your children to grow up with this. 

Get out. Now. You should have reheated his dinner, go to the kitchen get a bottle put in baby formula heat and serve. 

NTA what a baby! NTA head over to r/JustNoSo. They may offer more insight. NTA this is scary. He wakes you to make him food?!?! You work nonstop with the very young kids and still have to deal with this. This is not a loving partnership. It sounds controlling and abusive. Him blaming you is gaslighting. He, an adult, choose not to eat to prove a point. You must see this is not normal behavior. If you have someplace safe to go, like a friend or family, go and take a break. I think you'll see how unhealthy this relationship is if you take a step back. My dad literally does the same thing to my mom, except my mom works and makes about 4x more what he does. My instinct would be to leave this man immediatly because I would never ever in my life marry someone who does nothing around the house and treats me like a servant. Waking you up because the big baby doesn’t wanna take a plate from the fridge and put it in a microwave? Absolutely fucking not. Not even one bit. Trashy, rude and overall disgusting behavior on his part. Absolutely horrendous and gross. The amount of negative English words I know doesn’t even cover how strongly I feel about this. NTA and get a lawyer. He's an a****** pretending to be a grown-up. He thinks he's a king, in reality he's a misogynistic insensitive a******. Tell him this isn't the 1950s. Tell him the next time he wakes you up out of a sound sleep after taking care of his children he can f****** well start cooking for himself. Any man who can't warm up his own damn dinner has something seriously wrong with him. And he gets to clock out at the end of his work shift. Yours is 24/7. I'd like to see him take care of those young children all on his own for one week. What is this, 1950? He can reheat his own food. He's not 3. My 4yo is more responsible than this. Yes, he works all day, but so do you! Kids don't take care of themselves! I would not prepare a single meal for him until you get a decent apology, and honestly... He sounds like a bad husband. There is absolutely no reason why a grown, capable adult should wake another adult to ask them to prepare or reheat a meal for them. I'd probably change the locks next time he's at work. Good riddance! NTA NTA. This man doesn't want a partner, he wants a mother. Is that what you want to be to him? NTA

Most comments have covered everything, especially the top rated one, but I'd also like to add that I really think your husband needs to be more respectful of what you do. Treating a SAHM like they are not doing anything just because their job is at home is not OK. It's like he thinks he has the say and control in everything just because what he does makes money. What you do is equally as important and helpful for your family. he needs to understand that. I agree with the majority that maybe talking it through with a neutral person (like a counsellor) is the correct call here, otherwise your husband sounds like he is just going to shout/talk over you whatever you say I'm reminded of Blazing Saddles, ""Nobody move or the n\*gger gets it""

He went to bed hungry because he can't manage the microwave? Or does he just think that anything in the kitchen is 'women's work'.

You are NTA, and the solution you came up with is fine. I’m terrified for OP, bc if he acts this way about meals, I can only shudder at how he must approach sex. NTA, but unless your husband has recently suffered a head injury, this is not the first instance of psycho abuse. He needs help, but you do too. Talk to a professional to help you see what’s going on here and then find some alternatives. NTA. And you are working non stop too. Just at home. He better figure out how to use that microwave. Otherwise I would stop making food for him period if I were you. You work just as long hours as he does. And you do it with a toddler AND infant by yourself!! He has at least 1 partner helping him at work. You obviously have none since he can't even be bothered to feed himself its like you have 3 kids op!! NTA. Get out. Move in with mom. Divorce him. Marriage counseling. But honestly, therapy/counseling ain’t gonna save this. Not even if you get a job so he isn’t the “breadwinner”. He will keep doing it to control you. Get out. So what is he going to do if OP is suddenly in hospital for a week? Or has to leave for a family emergency for several weeks? Starve himself to death? Not do basic cleaning in his home? Run out of clothes because he works too hard to now do laundry? NTA. OP, you need to run.  This man is abusive. And it's only going to get worse. NTA !!

I worked as a First Responder with 24hour shifts for years. We were in a refugee camp and sometimes had over a hundred patients per shift (yes, only two of us for the whole camp). There were many times I couldn't eat sth this whole time and just barely drink some water. 

So, I can absolutely understand being exhausted after a stressful and long shift in this work field. 

With absolutely no doubt is he TA here!

I wouldn't have ever thought to wake my spouse up like this. I even felt guilty when he woke up because of me not being quiet enough coming home from or leaving for work.

I was soooo thankful, when he precooked sth I only had to heat up. And if he didn't and I was really tired, I just ate some cereal, a sandwich or whatever. 

I am responsible for taking care of myself, no one else! Some help is highly appreciated but never ever expected.

I would look out for and think about other situations and character traits of him, where this kind of disrespectful behaviour and mindset shows.The situation you described is usually a sign of a major character flaw and typically not just a single incident. Know your worth, as he seems to not.

(To add: if I was really exhausted, I preferred sleep over food. And that he can still scream at you for hours after the shift shows for a fact, he had enough strength to reheat the dinner and wasn't even near to passing out because of hunger or exhaustion. He is a liar and just a lazy AH) Run.
 
 
NTA This is controlling behavior, a type of psychological abuse. Get out before this escalates.
NTA NTA NTA NTA,

as a past victim of emotional abuse and manipulation, reading this made my stomach lurch into my throat. he's trying to maintain control over you by acting like this and is reflecting that of a child, not a grown ass man w a job and children. please seek outside counsel if you intend on maintaining this relationship w him as someone like this will not reason w you and will only become more hostile if you attempt to call him out and settle it yourself NTA. Pack a bag for you, pack a bag for your 3 year old, pack a bag for your 6 month old, and walk out the door to the car and leave, go wherever you can. That was awful to read, this man doesn't care about you at all. I'm sorry he did this to you. But, you don't deserve it. Excuse me? Your husband comes home at 11pm and shouts you awake because he couldn't be bothered to heat up his own dinner? I'm sorry to tell you but you're married to a turbo asshole.

He was in no way about to ""pass out from hunger"". He is not a helpless infant child. A person who is that hungry would not go to bed having not eaten just to spite you. He's a manipulative asshole and I'm not being dramatic when I say I'd be rethinking my marriage if I were you. NTA. NTA 

Your husband is abusive. This is abuse. You have normalized a lot of really shitty abusive behavior. 

Please talk a local domestic violence advocate. He may escalate his behavior now because you're starting to not respond to the emotional abuse he has kept you in line with. Having 3 kids is fucking hard. I’m so sorry you don’t have support. 🚩 this is abuse NTA
I’m BEG you, divorce this man!!! Dude if I was you I would just leave the leftovers of whatever I made on the stove so that he could just grab it out of there but from how he sounds he might expect you to go and serve him even though you’re asleep. Talk about awful toxic Nta. This is not just about food dear. This guy is scary. Girl. Run. NTA. But your parasite is. NTA oh honey…. run. i recently got out of an abusive marriage and this is how it started. we both worked full time and he would get mad at me for not having dinner cooked and the house clean for him…. like, get up and do it your damn self? it stayed like that for a little bit and continuously got worse. eventually it got physical. i packed my stuff in the middle of the night when he was at work and never saw him again. please get out before it gets worse. NTA. Get out of there. 

This isn’t just about dinners. This is about control and manipulation. “If I pass out from hunger it’ll be your fault” is emotional manipulation. He’s a grown ass fucking man. He can reheat a dinner. NTA

Waking you up while you’re sleeping, demanding you reheat food that you’ve already spent time preparing for him, and trying to put the blame on you for him going to bed hungry… 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

This is mental and emotional abuse! Please don’t let this continue! It’s not healthy for you or for your children to see you being treated like that. If he can’t recognize the amount of work and effort you put in on a daily basis caring for the children, house, and him, he doesn’t deserve you. 

Please know that you are worth more than this and get out! NTA

He doesn’t care about you or your well being…

He has the audacity of interrupting your sleep just because he thinks he’s to good to reheat his own damn food. It’s not a damn chore. It’s called feeding himself. You already did the chore of cooking the meal.

He’s controlling and disrespectful. He doesn’t see you as a partner. He thinks he owns you because he works and belittles your contribution to the household. He wants to be king and you are his bang maid. NTA, it isn’t about the food, it’s a control thing. My husband also works in ems. We meal prep together and hear yo our own food if the other isn’t home, awake, whatever. Even after workin a 24 hour shift he doesn’t wake me and the kids up, he knows how to work a microwave. NTA. run. he is abusing you WHAT?? I assume heating up food means using the microwave oven. That takes a few minutes of one's time.

It sounds like more is going on here than just heating the food. He says you aren't doing enough. I doubt you are sitting on the couch eating bonbons and watching tv all day with the two young ones that you take care of. It sounds like he is jealous of your job compared to his. It sounded like you described my ex husband. He would pull stuff like this and wake the baby and I was expected to cater to his every need and then get the baby back to sleep. Seven years of hell. Your husband is controlling you and you should think about taking those kids with you to your mom’s house. As you try to gain some freedom and independence, he will only try to control you more. NTA OP but this is definitely more than that. NTA. I’m a first responder on 12 hour shifts and it’s difficult for me to even get to a restroom, let alone eat. My kids and partner are sometimes asleep when I get home. I’m an adult, so instead of waking anyone up, I make my own food. 

While I still vote NTA, question for you.. is this how it’s always been or did something change recently? Is he prone to violent outbursts? Many of my coworkers have PTSD from something that happened at work. Our jobs also make us more at risk for many different health problems. The thing is, though, it is HIS responsibility to take care of himself. If he is dealing with mental health issues, he needs to be proactive in getting them dealt with. OP, get divorced, start looking for a job... This is a huuuuge red flag. 

Like others said, this is not about the food, it's about him controlling you... 

And being a sahm is one of the most exhausting jobs ever, every man needs to know this. 

Op, your husband is the AH. My dad used to do this to my mom. He would emotionally abuse her and wake her up in the night asking her to serve him food even tho he can do it himself since it’s there ready in the kitchen. We the kids would argue with him to leave her alone it would be exhausting for all of us (6kids) He would tell her how shit of a woman she was because she wouldn’t do things she said. It almost turned physical but my older brother stopped him from doing anything further than a slap. I’m the second oldest (female) by the way. I hated my dad for doing this to my mom, he made me disappointed in him for doing all this. We finally left the house in July 2019 and are now doing better without him. The scars are all still there though from me not being able to trust men, and then my siblings also have other problems but it’s okay for us because we’re together and sometimes we talk about how our dad acted made us feel so sad. So we feel better because we aren’t alone in this. My dad lives alone now, and I feel bad for him but you know he did this to himself. I can’t trust him again because he would lie so much about how he will change so we should stay all of it was bullshit. He also never visits us only calls for birthdays sometimes. We spent 20 years in that house and I believe my mom deserves better than that he lost an incredible woman. She now has a boyfriend who always goes above and beyond for her. He tries to do things with us even though sometimes we don’t want to do things with him. It’s not that we don’t like him it’s just weird. As long as my mom is happy I’m happy. So I don’t know your full situation but your not the asshole he is and if he continues to do this and doesn’t listen to what you have to say honestly as my mom went through that I would say leave him because if you’re not okay your kids won’t be either you know kids can see when you’re are having a hard time. Hope this helps. Sending good vibes your way. you need to get outta there lady OP please figure out a safe exit strategy and get out. This is incredibly abusive and you've done nothing wrong. Please for the safety of you and your children leave when he's at work and get somewhere safe. OP didn’t say this explicitly, but it sounds like the husband feels he should be waited on because he is working and she is a SAHM. That means he values the money being brought in more than his family and his children. I also agree that his behavior is about control and his behavior is unacceptable. 

OP, you control how people treat you. I hate to say it, but you’ve allowed him to do this for however long, so now he expects it. It’s great you are drawing this boundary, but it’s not surprising he has this reaction when you’ve catered to him for however long. He hasn’t respected you and you’ve also allowed this. I hope you learn to respect yourself more. NTA. Man didn’t have the energy to re-heat, but he expended a whole lot of energy yelling and being petty. I know he works a difficult job, but you do too. Hoping this is a one off, but I doubt it from your first paragraph. I’d recommend some couples counseling. But I wish someone had told me when I was younger that boundaries are essential, & relationships shouldn’t be this much work. NTA. 

My husband works on call and often has to go out at all hours even after working long hours all day. I’m a SAHM. If he’s not home when I make dinner I stick it in the fridge and he nukes it when he gets home. I pre make him pancakes and keep bread available and get pre-cooked bacon and sausage so he has options for his own breakfast. He takes leftovers with him or picks up food for lunch. He says thank you for cooking for him. THIS is normal. Your husband sounds abusive and controlling. I’m sorry. nta

did you marry a child? this sounds like a toddler NTA- I thought you said you had 2 children, not 3.

&#x200B;

Not only is he an incapable arsehole, he clearly doesn't care about you. You spend all day looking after a toddler and a baby and he WAKES you at 11? I have no words.

I'd leave in your shoes. He's never going to get better and you will have a lifetime of tiptoeing around him and being yelled at when you object to being treated like a servant. NTA.

I’m an EMT and have worked 24 hour shifts. I have come home starving and nothing has stopped me from making my own food. Hell if I didn’t want to make something myself I’d just pull up to a drive through. Your husband is toxic and acting abusive. I’m so proud of you for sticking up for yourself and stands g your ground. He’s pathetic for refusing to reheat already made food, trying to guilt you for “going to bed hungry”, and for turning off his phone. What a child. I’m sorry he’s treating this way. NTA

My kids could reheat food in the microwave from the time they were in grade school. 

This isn't about the food. It's about control and it's abuse. NTA. Your husband is seriously controlling and does not think of your needs at all. He's a big boy, and he can reheat his dinner himself, and even cook for himself when you can't (or simply don't want to!) do it yourself. You need to confront him (if you feel safe doing so), tell him he's now on his own when it comes to food when you're asleep, and then hold that line. This is a hill to die on.

If possible, marriage counseling might be a good thing, too. NTA 

He‘s starving himself to be petty to prove a point. The point being that he’s a giant baby. My response to ""I'm going to bed hungry,"" would have been, ""Okay. Good night."" Christ, what an asshole. NTA. I mean he pays for the bills the least you can do is have his dinner ready when he gets home I feel anxiety just reading your post.
This is unbearable.

This is abuse. 

Protect yourself, please, reach out for help.

NTA Nta im surprised they allow babies to drive ambulances It’s one thing if he woke you up as he missed you and wanted company for dinner. This is just him wanting to be in control. NTA. May be THAT red flag that should get you preparing to eventually leave for your and your children’s safety. It’s one thing if he woke you up as he missed you and wanted company for dinner. This is just him wanting to be in control. NTA. May be THAT red flag that should get you preparing to eventually leave for your and your children’s safety. NTA - anytime he tries this shit i would be telling him im calling the whambulance. he can fucking starve until he learns to use the microwave himself NTA - your jackass of a husband can’t press 3 buttons on the microwave?  What happened between the end of his shift and him coming home that caused him to break his hands?

Also, who the FUCK comes home at 11pm while having young kids sleeping yelling asking where his dinner is?  

You married a monster OP.  It might be wise to take the kids and move in with your parents? NTA this is abuse OP. Get some therapy for yourself at the very least. How far away is your mom? Might be time for an extended visit. WHAT?? 
Your being petty? He literally won’t heat up the food YOU made. And now he’s “passing out from hunger” w.t.h
NTA YTA to yourself if you stay w this man. Hang on. Your husband is an “ambulance driver”? 

This is made up because he would be a paramedic, not an “ambulance driver” and the wife of a paramedic would know this. 
YTA for making shit up. Every time someone complains about their SO on here it’s a chorus of divorce advocates NTA but just so you know it's a huge dick move to call an EMT or paramedic an ""ambulance driver."" It does not endear us to you. NTA but your husband is definitely an asshat. I cannot fathom being WOKEN UP to put something in the microwave for a physically capable person. The audacity and entitlement is mind boggling. Especially since you went through the effort of having individual meals prepared for him to eat. I’d have a frying pan in bed with me for the next time he needs help reheating food. Maybe a little whoops upside the head will knock some common sense and decency into him. NTA. Wtf. NTA Get those kids out of there and away from his influence before they both turn into him! The ring on your finger does NOT make you his slave. He won't change, so don't fall for that either. Info: why are you expected to have meals ready for him?  Are you both equals in the household and family care? NTA. Even hired servants work limited hours. Just because he is in a demanding job, it doesn’t mean you are on call for his demands 24/7. You already have a job like that because of parenthood. Tell him that if he “almost passed out” because he needed to wait a couple of minutes to heat up his dinner, he needs to consult a doctor. I’m a type 1 diabetic and I don’t have that happen to me! NTA. He thinks you owe him for providing for the family but has zero appreciation for your contribution to the family. 
When I stayed home I took on the majority of the HH chores and cooking and I was so grateful my husband could provide while was the primary parent. Never once did he assume I would drop everything for him and sometimes I would just tell him to pick something up on his way home. 
You’re not in a partnership at all and he is a child. He’s embarrassing. Personally I have no patience for this behavior and wouldn’t tolerate any of this. there is only one question you should be asking yourself here, OP: do you really want to be with a man that “can’t reheat his own dinner”? NTA. NTA but I don't know why you ever got into this habit to begin with. He is an EMT and can't use a microwave? He's TA for sure because his behavior was childish. NTA NTA. He is abusing you. please look up womens shelters in your area, they have resources to get you help. I wish you luck. 

I was a kid that had a dad similar to this (there was a lot more going on) but kids being in that situation is really not good. do it for your kids. NTA. My husband works about 10 hours and still doesn't have these expectations. You're his partner not his maid. Even if he didn't care about you,he should want someone well rested to care for his kids. I don't think I could stay with someone who maintain cares so little about my sleep. NTA. He sounds like a jerk and as others have said, potentially abusive. I’m sorry. You're in an abusive marriage with an abusive man who punishes you if you don't do exactly as he says all the time. You're not is servant or his slave. He is a grown man who can put food in the microwave. 

Please please move out asap and start filing for divorce. Wouldn't you be devastated if your children grew up and ended up like this man or ended up in a marriage similar to yours? NTA but serious question, what would be his response if you were too sick to feed him? Basically, it's this man a narcissist or what's his story here? Because I used to be with a guy kinda like this, and they don't get better - only worse. NTA

What does he think single people who work do? NTA. I would honestly be tempted to patronize the hell out of him and give him a “lesson” on how to use a microwave, since he is clearly not smart enough to figure it out. “Oh, honey, did no one ever show you how a microwave works?” This man is ridiculous. Let him starve, I guess. Honestly, reading this brought back so many memories of witnessing abuse growing up. OP, not only are you NTA, but you need to leave this man. Nope - he’s responsible for his own body being hungry and for his actions. I’m snarky and I would have said - how is it you can drive an ambulance but not know how to use the microwave/oven? Or better yet I would have reheated his dinner and put it on the table - using your kids baby bottle for the drink, kids plate and utensils ne a bib- if he’s going to act like a helpless baby he gets treated as one. And how he has no respiratory you and cares nothing for his children- if your 6m and 3yo wakes up to daddy yelling the LOs are going to be frightened- does he want his children afraid of him? Get you and those babies outta there.

NTA NTA NTA, but your husband is. He's a grown man, capable of feeding himself. You've already done him a favor by preparing meals that are ready to heat. He needs to grow up.  Jesus. That is ridiculous and borderline abusive. Do not give into him. Whatever you do, do not heat up his food for him. 
This is not a man you want to be with forever. 
Working does not mean you don't do any chores anyways! NTA, hes not a child, reheating doesnt take more than 5 minutes if its frozen solid. Listen to other comments here and reevaluate your situation. NTA. It’s not 1950. They should be grateful their spouse made them anything at all. Marriage is rarely 50-50. From my experience, sometimes it’s 70-30 then 40-60 depending on the needs of the other. In this case it sounds like it’s always 95-5. He needs an attitude adjustment. NTA



Has his behavior been different recently and or changed drastically? You don't have to answer and the reason I ask this is because Paramedic and EMTs see some rough stuff and experience God awful situations, so I'm wondering if/thinking he may have PTSD? NTA...you were working all day too. Just because one job is paid and the other is not does not mean that one job is harder or more valuable than the other. 

I am the sole bread winner in my family, and my spouse is a SAHP. I cook dinner every day because we're a team and we're both doing what needs to get done for our family. Money is just one of the things we need in order to take care of our family; it's irrelevant who is the person obtaining the money. We're both busy working towards our goal of taking care of our family, and that's the part that matters. If we switched positions and my spouse went to work and I stayed home, I would feel exactly the same way. This is abusive. NTA. NTA run.... NTA. A marriage, especially with young kids, needs to be a partnership where you work together, help each other. He's not the centre of the universe anymore, his kids now take that place and he needs to act like a grown up and heat his own dinner. Super NTA. If you can drive an ambulance you can drive a car. And honestly, he's super ungrateful and kind of a dick for not appreciating two days of work you put in and acting like he's the only one that works hard around there. Others have said it but if this is constant behavior you guys need to have a serious talk about expectations cuz he seems to be living in Dreamland. NTA, of course, but you've got much bigger problems.  Your husband is controlling, misogynistic, and emotionally abusive.  He is deeply selfish, and he is contemptuous and disrespectful to you.

You can try marriage counseling, but my guess is that he will refuse to go, or he will refuse to listen and learn how to be a decent husband.  

I suggest you start planning for being on your own.  You need to be able to support yourself and your baby.  You cannot trust your husband. NTA
But this is bigger than you being an ah or not. This man is abusive. Even if he hasn’t put his hands on you, abuse is more than just physical. And honestly, all the people I know who stayed in emotionally/mentally/financially abusive relationships ended up with it getting physical in some way. 
Please get away as soon as it is safe to do so. Please tell your mum what is happening, get her help. You cannot stay with this man and keep you and your children safe. He may be a n adult physically, but he definitely is a child mentally and emotionally.  I am surprised he didn't hold his breath or stomp his feet! He is the AH here, not you.  Has he always been this entitled? NTA! NTA. Your husband is a chauvinistic ass, though. NTA - Hes just being lazy. It's not a lot of work to put a plate in a microwave and press a button. He went to bed hungry of his own accord. NTA you know one thing I always wondered which is somewhat irrelevant I  suppose is how some men make their wives make their plate. I seen someone do it when we were out somewhere, I can’t remember where. But  I’m like hey woman go get my plate.  she’s like fuck you, get your own shit. I was just kidding and she knows it. We got to talking about it and she’s like I wouldn’t even know what to put on it you know how much you want of whatever you want and it would make it awkward. but it’s just a control thing I think to some men, because I wanna make my own plate if I want a little more potatoes than I do corn I’ll know to get it instead of having someone go guess what I want.  does that make sense? Think about it. If he wasn’t married, he’d still have to work at his job wouldn’t he? He’s have to cook, clean and maintain his living area. So what is the difference now that he’s married? He just is using his work as an excuse to bully and demean you. NTA 

It’s not about dinner. It’s about his desire for status. There’s no room for that in a healthy marriage. 

OP your partner comes home at 11 and starts yelling. That shows zero respect for you but also, zero respect for his kids. 

You are the full time childcare provider yes? You are up with a 6 month old at night after parenting and cleaning and cooking all day, yes? 

You ensure a significant portion of your family income is saved because you take on the labor (childcare, housework, cooking) that would otherwise be outsourced. 

You work. He works. He is not a kind man based on this exchange and it’s most certainly not a one off. 

I worry for you. 

You made dinner. He refused to hear it up and says you tried to make the point???

Seriously. Worried for you. 

He provides finances and you provide everything else. That isn’t actually fair. NTA whaaat? he just started screaming for u without a care about waking the kids? your husband is in the wrong, he probably thinks u don't do shit cause you're a SAHM and that doesn't count as a real job. 10000% NTA NTA. He’s being rightfully dog piled for his entitlement and verbal abuse but can we just take a moment to focus on his silent treatment and turning off his phone? The crappy statement “YOU made go to bed hungry” as if you control his emotions and are to blame for his poor actions? These are the words and action of an emotional abuser. This is not going to get better without outside intervention. He has a fundemental disrespect and dysfunction for you and your marriage. NTA. 

This is clear manipulation and weaponized incompetence. Leave this man now. He seems to think that being the sole caretaker of 2 small children/babies is not working at all. You're the one who gets no breaks, not the other way around. This is very controlling and abusive behavior from your husband. 

If I were you, I'd pack up my necessities and take the children to my mother's to stay. When he gets home tonight he can fend for himself. Don't budge. 

You are NTA. NTA - does he realize that you are on call 24/7 with the kids, while he is only on call during his shifts? If anything, he should be taking over from you when he is off work, instead of adding to your workload. Head to counseling, or to a divorce lawyer. NTA - your husband sounds very controlling and toxic, his behaviour is not normal. Go back to work, become financially independent from him because there's a real chance that sooner or later you will want to leave him because he doesn't show you any respect whatsoever. He sounds abusive to be honest. NTA op. Your husband's behavior was childish and controlling. You said he works as an ambulance driver? That's kinda strange that someone married to a person that works in EMS would refer to them as an ambulance driver since it's usually considered really disrespectful. Work stress doesn't excuse his behavior but it could explain it. Sounds like he needs some professional help. NTA - I really, really don’t like your husband and I am worried for you. It’s early and I haven’t had my coffee yet but it is like he is the king of his home and you are all his subjects. His job is stressful but it doesn’t give him immediate tyrant rights as soon as he gets off work. NTA your Husband should be able to take care of himself enough to open the fridge, Get a bowl or plate, and then put it in the microwave for a minute. MAJOR RED FLAG. This is clearly not about food. 

Gently remind him that if you were not there, he'd have to feed himself!! Your husband sounds controlling and an arse. OP your husband is the asshole. He has absolutely no reason to speak to you this way, or expect this of you at all. He’s an adult and is responsible for fulfilling his own food needs when he is hungry. You preparing meals ahead of time is already above and beyond. 

Please do not allow yourself to be verbally/mentally/emotionally abused like this. He clearly needs therapy, and it’s also not your responsibility to stick around for him to figure out how he should treat his loving wife. NTA. Your husband is demonstrating controlling, sexist behavior that goes much deeper than a plate of food and will only get worse if left unaddressed. Nta,   Lots of 🚩here,  this is a hill to die on NTA, divorce or marriage counseling Honey, NTA. Your husband is, though. Big time. Major major red flags. It’s time to decide if you want to stay and find some resources to help if you don’t. (And please get cops involved if you decide to leave because it’s the most risky time for women in situations like this.) This is NOT NORMAL behavior. This is psychological abuse. NTA

By the way, did you know that you can do everything you're doing now *without an extra a-hole in the picture?*

It blows me away that this guy doesn't realize that most of his coworkers do the same job as him, then go home to prepare their own meals, and clean up afterwards. NTA. How hard is it to pop food in the microwave for a minute? Why do you have to wake up for that? It takes him longer to wake you up to reheat his dinner than it would take for him to just do it himself. NTA My daughter is an EMT and works crazy hours also. Her fiancé works a typical 8a to 5p job and they have an infant. She is very capable of making her own food, doing laundry, cleaning and taking care of baby. For the record I'm a nurse and travel for my job. Again I'm more then capable of doing all of those things for myself. If there's food to warm up I'm GRATEFUL and ELATED that that's the only effort I have to put into a hot meal. 

Your husband has an ego and control issue. Let me guess, his shit doesn't stink?! You are NOT a maid you are his partner. Your role is to care for those babies. His is to work and financially support the family which doesn't make him special. Having such young ones is a lot of work and how dare he have the audacity to wake you in such a way. 

This isn't normal behavior from a partner. I'd stop making him meals, doing his laundry etc until respect is restored. This for me as a woman is a deal breaker. You have two little ones but you may want to consider having a plan in place in case things get worse. The fact that he was yelling for you to get up at 11pm and potentially waking up a baby is abhorrent behavior and is abusive as Hell. How old is he?! That's not how ADULTS react to having to use a microwave. If no one has said this I NEED YOU TO HEAR ME!!! You are enough. You do enough. You deserve kindness, respect and support. Do not tolerate anything less than those things from your partner. NTA, I would leave my husband if he ever treated me like this and also expected to be treated like a god damn king and you like a servant. NTA but I think you married and had kids w the guy that thinks you're a bang maid. Damn. Read the top comment because that's all there is to say. NTA, does he not know how to push a button on a microwave oven? How can he drive an ambulance if he isn't even capable of pressing a button? Sounds like you are a servant,  not a wife. 
My husband ever even thought of acting that way towards me, he would no longer be my husband. Absolutely just no.

NTA NTA. A SAHP is home to parent. Home because frankly childcare costs are outrageous. Home to have bonding time with your children. It’s a full time plus overtime job. You don’t get waited on hand and foot. You wait on little babies and toddlers hand and foot. It’s a hard job. Your husband gets a night off, gets a day off. He probably gets to shower when he feels like it and go to bed when he gets off work. Meanwhile you are probably up through the night again with no help. He can make his own meals, he can reheat his own meals. But just know he isn’t treating you right at all if he expects you to be his personal maid and chef. He’s got days off, he can meal prep and help with chores. He sees you as his slave not his wife 🚩🚩🚩🚩NTA NTA. If he had passed out from hunger he would have shut the fuck up and let you sleep. Kick him out. Let him figure out how to act like an adult. NTA. But if you won't leave for yourself, leave him for the kids. When he yells, they can hear. If he hits you, they can hear. If they are older than the infant, they hear him screaming at mom and lie there terrified. Worried they will be next, worried he will hurt you, worried he will hurt them. 

Your husband is abusive. Him abusing you is hurting not only you but also your children. NTA.

Reheating a dinner plate isn't a chore. It's a preference. my heart actually feels for you bc i hate men who behave like this with all my existence. you are NOT the AH and i hope you truly believe that. i cannot believe that he could be so inconsiderate to wake you up for something so ridiculous. when does he pamper you? when does he heat up your food? when does he take care of the kids? his ability to be a high functioning adult doesnt end once he takes of his uniform. i am so appalled at this ew. 

regardless of if you were awake already, reheating his food wouldn’t have changed his behaviour. he would have realised that he can wear you down eventually and he will continue to kick up a fuss until you do this. 

you deserve so much more than this man seems to be offering. reading ""almost passed out from hunger""? Poor baby. When he is older he will be able to eat his food raw or learn to use the microwave. Send him back to kindergarden and RUN away from him! He is not spouse material. Do not share home or family with him.

&#x200B;

NTA, please run! NTA You and your children deserve so much better than this. He cares more about control than about his family. Please seek out some support. NTA. I think he needs his own ambulance OP, I get that being an ambulance driver, especially in this current situation, is not easy, but he went way overboard. Can it really be called a chore to take a dish out of the fridge to the microwave for a few button presses? Please see this as a huge red flag, he's blaming you that he's going hungry when he could easily remedy the situation with minimum energy. NTA. NTA. He seems manipulative and abusive. You better run w/ the kids. NTA, your husband is an adult and he needs to learn to act like it. NTA. What an ass. NTA. The fact that you have to pause taking care of your kids to make your perfectly able husband a meal is a huge red flag. The fact that he screams at you is a huge red flag. 

> starts laughing sarcastically 

This also is a huge red flag. NTA. He’s an asshole. Just because you’re a SAHM, doesn’t mean you are a slave to his needs. All he had to do was reheat his dinner instead of acting like an entitled asshole. NTA,

Marrying a man does not fucking entail you becoming his slave. Whether he had children or not or even lived alone he would have to figure out his food situation on his own, you were kind enough to prepare meals for him to enjoy once he got off work which is a damn lot because you’ve already put the time, effort, and labor into doing this. Not to mention on top of that you’re taking care of children 24/7 with what it sounds like absolutely no help from him. This is an abusive relationship because his inability to communicate like a civilized human being and intentionally yelling to get attention is manipulative. I wouldn’t even recommend therapy because this isn’t some petty squabble this is straight up abuse. Pack your stuff and your Childrens stuff and find a good divorce lawyer. With all the damn trouble he’s giving you you’re better off doing it alone or with someone who actually loves you that may be willing to help like your mom because you do not need a third child to take care of. NTA hubby is a massive AH. i wouldn't even prep him meals anymore. he owes you a massive apology. NTA - he needs to reheat his own food and he sounds like an asshole !!!

I do however want to point out that the term “ambulance driver” is offensive to emts and paramedics. NTA, he's gonna be pretty upset when you divorce him and he has to make his own meals and then some. NTA. This is very, very not okay behavior. As others have pointed out, this is about control, not hunger. Please do not let your children grow up in this house. NTA.

Your normal meter is broken. Because this is not normal behavior from a rational and logical adult. “I’m gonna starve myself to make you feel bad so you’ll go back to sleep deprivation!”???

Did you grow up in a dynamic like this? I’m assuming not bc it was your mom who suggested the totally appropriate and reasonable solution of having your husband  reheat meals. 

You work too. A 24 hour job. You are a stay at home MOM. Not a stay at home slave. You are entitled to sleep. 

You really need to examine if this is how you want to spend the rest of your life. And if this is what you want your children to witness growing up. 

You and your kids deserve better. My god…your husband is a major a-hole. I hope you weren’t actually serious about asking if you were TA….you aren’t and I’m sorry your husband has gaslight into thinking you are. The fact is that your husband is abusing you…and has been for a long time or you wouldn’t be asking this question. You’d be completely horrified at his behavior and tell him not to come home until he fixes his attitude and behavior. You are NTA NTA. but you need to consider if you want to bring up 2 children in this environment. NTA

I work 12-14 hours a day and I come home and cook for my fiancé half the time- the hours are not an excuse or the reason he’s doing this. Girl you don’t know how terrifying this is to read.            
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

You need to get professional help for your relationship. This isn’t going to get better. Those are serious abuse warning signs at the very least, I would say he is already emotionally abusive and extremely manipulative. Do something before you and your children are unsafe! NTA - your husband gives all of us men a bad name with his behavior. Lady, leave in the middle of the day with your kids and head on over to a divorce attorney. Go stay with your parents as you get this settled. This man is about 2 steps from hitting you, in front of your kids. Causing trauma to both you AND your kids. Who’s to say he won’t harm the kids? He’s already waking them up in the middle of the night screaming. Leave this piece of trash. YOU can do better. You DESERVE better It’s not the 1950’s anymore. He should reheat his own damn dinner. NTA. Nta. Divorce. Right the f now. Ain’t nobody worth being treated like a slave for. You are worth So much more. Read. So many comments. So many books. 

Why does he do that?
Boundaries After a Pathological Relationship
Co-dependant No More (or newer version The New Co-dependancy)
Journey Through Trauma

Look up the Power and Abuse Wheel. Google it. Same as the Cycle of Abuse.

You, beautiful and strong woman, deserve so much better than this. Believe it. Dont let him break you. You have two children to live for.

Run. 

Nta. This isnt about food. Understand that fact. This is not about food. I am a doctor in the A&E, I get more tired at home with my baby that at work. SAHM is a job too. NTA, this is abuse. NTA. I wouldn't consider re-heating my food a chore. NTA

You're his servant. Not a partner. That man does *not* love or respect you.

This is abuse. Why the hell are you with him? 

*Leave*. Why do so many women marry AHs and put up with being treated in an abusive way, even have children with them, and then they suddenly realize one day that their husband is an AHs and that they get treated badly.

Don't go for the manly confident charmers, go for the considerate men with empathy and marry those instead. 

NTA in this situation, but you are asking such an obvious question. 
You are in an abusive relationship. He will not change. You will either work yourself ill and have a mental breakdown  or get a divorce eventually.

Have a look here for great resources.
https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/relationships/ My fiance works 40 hours a week, comes home, empties the cat boxes, putters in the garage, and then cooks dinner. Sometimes I'll make dinner while he plays a video game, and then he puts up leftovers and does dishes. He is cooking us breakfast now as I type. Your husband is a jerk. NTA NTA NTA. NTA- maybe remind him if you all divorce he won't have any one to make him dinner let alone reheat it for him. Well I guess he's going to starve. Good for you.

NTA. He's a manipulative, controlling asshole. Ooh an abuser. Yeah, NTA. Leave him wow what a snowflake! NTA N T A  this guy married himself a maid not a wife. time to teach him the difference. NTA. You are better than me OP. I’d have walked in the kitchen and thrown the dinner away and tell him sorry I guess no dinner tonight. NTA. This is outright abusive behavior on his part. I am Soo sorry you are in this situation. And I hate to say this, but I don't think counseling is will improve this situation. He is a self-centered mean abusive A-H. NTA. OP, you are in an abusive relationship. This man is ABUSIVE. I reckon this isn’t the first outburst. Please keep yourself safe. I make my partner premade meals he can heat up too. Ya know what he says to me in the AM after I’ve rested and not been woken up by him being a baby? “what you made this week was bomb! I ate one hot and one cold while it was warming up. Can I bring some to the neighbors? Their dog died.” 

That’s how a normal man behaves. They eat risotto cold and enjoy it. 

Your husband is being a dick for no reason. NTA as everyone else said, and can I add: one of the most alarming things about this is that OP asked if the laughing was the problem. 

The laughing IS NOT THE PROBLEM. 

It’s the expectations, the lack of regard for your health or wellness, the dismissiveness of the work you do, and his insanely childish refusal to provide himself basic care by pushing a few buttons on the oven out of spite. 

You are worth a husband who cares if you sleep and says thank you for what you do. Please leave him ASAP. Tell your mom what happened. To be honest…I’m a grown-ass man. I can feed myself.  I’m never going to “pass out” to prove in a child that needs coddling. Would i appreciate the effort…of course!  But to expect it tells me all i need to know. NTA but damn, why you marry a child NTA but you need to bring this up with him IMMEDIATELY. If he won't listen, pack your things and stay with friends or family until he hears you out. 

Once a line like this is crossed you *must* put your foot down and tell him that this behaviour is unacceptable. If you let this go unchecked he has broken a line of acceptable behaviour and will feel free to move on to the next line which will be worse. If he is unwilling to talk to you or listen to you about it then it is clear indication that things are going to get worse here on out and make a plan for what you are going to do about that.

This isn't about really about how hard he works, does he help you and treat you with more respect on his days off? I thought not. 

Your children do not deserve to learn this is how relationships work (and how women should be treated) and you do not deserve to live a life of unrelenting sh*t. NTA

Im active duty, my wife is a SAHM, I leave for work at 5am, get home most nights around 6pm.  I still do work around the house with her.  Dishes, cooking, cleaning etc 

Life is about team work - he is essentially telling you that he does not consider what you do to be work.  

Do not make a single meal again until he apologizes And when he left you changed the locks and left his stuff in the front yard, right??? 

NTA, but he is a major controlling one. Leave him now He’s an ambulance driver, mate. Important as fuck, but he’s nothing special. Spending two days to prepare meals *specifically for your husband* is incredibly thoughtful. Shame there’s zero gratitude for it.

I’d start slowly replacing his (out-of-work) clothes with big, frilly dresses, shiny pumps and tiaras. He wants to act like a princess, he can fucking dress like one Wow! I am amazed at your situation! Your husband is being very chauvinistic, arrogant, lazy,selfish,inconsiderate, childish, and rude. If I were you I would change all the door locks before he gets off work. Today. Completely unacceptable and shows you exactly what you have to look forward to in the future if you stay with him. NTA
In that hour he was being a selfish jerk he could've not only reheated his dinner but made a whole new meal. Honestly I don't even know what to say except wtf? Honey, im so sorry you even felt like you were an asshole enough to make this post. 

You are NTA

You are a golden woman. Please take care of yourself and your kids. You are so sweet. NTA, let him die in hunger if he can't even reheat his own food. It's not he's going to cook a full course meal. Do not give in. He’s being crazy! Stand your ground. He either takes care of himself or figures something out. NTA. NTA. To echo everyone else, this is abuse and has nothing to do with pressing start on the microwave. 

And I’m willing to bet that this is not the first red flag you’ve encountered. 

You are not a servant. You are not a slave. This is not 1956. 

Oh, and that laugh? He laughed because you stood up for yourself and he feels disrespected. Next time, he won’t be laughing. The notion that you’re making him starve is on the same playing field as physically abusive partners saying “you made me angry so I had to hit you.”

I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I truly hope you think about what’s truly best for you and your babies. NTA and your husband needs to grow up. 

Here’s some anecdotal context. My husband and I divide labor in our house: I cook, he does laundry. We both work more than full time, because he owns a business and I have a day job, in addition to working for his business part time. We each work about 75-80 hours a week. Because I do all the cooking (he hates cooking and he’s bad at it), I’m generally “responsible” for meals. But he does laundry, because if you hand me a pile of clothes that are red and white, you’ll end up with a bunch of pink socks and stuff. Laundry just is not in my skillset. 

BUT. If I have to work off-site one day, and I don’t come home to make lunch like I usually do, my husband just gets his own damned lunch. He’ll be pretty excited about dinner when I get home, because he likes my cooking, but he’ll munch on stuff while I’m gone if he’s hungry. Likewise, if I need a shirt cleaned and he’s not available, I can and will throw some stuff in the washer. This is just being an adult human. 

If the general division of labor in your house is that you’re the sahm and cook/housekeeper, while he works out of the home, that’s totally fine if you’re both comfortable with it. What’s NOT fine is for him to throw a temper tantrum because one time you didn’t do what he expected. Sometimes, things do not go as planned, and we have to pick up something we don’t usually do. It shouldn’t be the end of the world, and anyone who acts like it is needs to get their head on straight. Remind me! 24hrs NTA. So he has the energy to yell at you from across the house and laugh like an asshole in your face, and then to later yell at you again but not to put a dish in the microwave and stand there for a couple minutes? 
You should also talk to him about the fact that taking care of a young child and a baby is also a full time job! That has no time off at all. NTA, NTA are you fucking kidding me?? A grown ass man can't handle putting his own dinner in the microwave??. My husband works full time, physically demanding jobs, but he still comes home and cooks and does chores and makes sure I'm ok. No offense, but you need to lawyer up and get out because he is a grade A loser taking advantage of you. NTA and this is abusive behavior. Please stand your ground. NTA. Mans was already an asshole when he expected food as soon as he got back home, the fact that he can’t just microwave some food makes him an even bigger asshole. It’s seriously just microwaving. Open fridge door, grab food, open microwave door, put in food, close microwave door, beep boop, wait, open microwave, food done. Nothing complicated, even a toddler can do that. NTA.  He's a grown adult and doesn't need a maid.  He works hard, but you can't be getting up at all hours to teach him how to use the microwave. Why is this grown ass man acting so childish? He can’t throw a PRE-MADE meal in the microwave for thirty seconds? Does he not know how to use the microwave?

> I’ve basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I’m petty trying to prove a point

Genuinely starting to think he doesn’t know how to use a microwave, because it sounds like he basically made HIMSELF almost pass out from hunger just to prove a point. NTA Omg what a pansy. I've worked 12 he shifts for most of my healthcare career. Not once did I expect my husband to heat up dinner for me when I got home. That late I usually didn't want to eat anyway, it would be a bowl of cereal and then bedtime. And usually when I got home (around 8/830 am/pm) I would put my child to bed/get them ready for daycare because I missed them all day. 
All this to say he's perfectly capable of heating up a plate of food. NTA! Wtf. It would be one thing if he came home and you were up and the kids were asleep. Yea sure let me reheat this meal for you, but only if you offered. But he woke you up! NTA - I don’t care how hard he works, he can attend to his own meal after his shift. Does he think his single colleagues just starve? You made him a whole meal, he just has to nuke it.

The people saying this is not about food are 100% right. I hope OP can get some assistance to make this relationship work. NTA. My husband is an emergency dispatcher working 12 shifts and thanks me when he comes home to a meal in the fridge he heats up himself.  Your husband is a pathetic loser because he can’t heat up his own meal. Tell him he can reheat it himself or he can cook his own meal because you won’t be making meals for him anymore. To quote Whoopi Goldberg from Ghost, “you in danger, girl”.
This is NOT about dinner. This is how much he can control you. It will only get worse with time. Take the kids and leave for good. NTA!

You were also working an entire shift nonstop (taking care of two very young kids!) And have been doing plenty of chores! Does he force his paramedic to make his lunch for him while working?  I know the ones I worked with wouldn’t put up with that BS. It’s SAHM not SAHW. NTA but your husband sure is.

If he's so inept at heating up a precooked dinner, then he has no business driving an ambulance.  He's a grown ass, able-bodied man. If he can wipe his own bottom, he can heat up his own dinner. Your holding down the fort at home and he's acting like an entitled brat. NTA What he is doing is some old style Patriarchal women's work is not valued, women are not valued, women are here to serve me, the Lord and Master abuse. He is a perfect example of toxic masculinity.

He doesn't know how to microwave? You DID feed him. He is an abusive ass. Protect yourself. NTA - He sounds very abusive. I'd take my children and leave if I were you. He's controlling and immature. He needs counselling and you need counselling together if you want to stay married. This will escalate. Go somewhere safe and only see him for counselling appointments and make sure visitations with the children is supervised. His behaviour proves he doesn't care about their well-being. NTA. RUN. 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 I genuinely don’t understand why any woman would be in a relationship like this in 2022. I feel like a large majority of the SAHMs who get treated like this and tell stories like this would be better off on their own. What is he bringing to your life that you can’t do yourself? It just seems like the only person who benefits from this these days is the husband. 

If you left him he’d still have to go to work every day and the pay the bills. Now he’d just have to also do his own household tasks, make his own meals, and on top of that take care of the children entirely on his own whenever he has custody. 

You’d have one less person to cook for/ clean up after/ take care of and you’d ALSO have financial freedom and possibly split custody (giving you time off! A luxury for a SAHM). 

I really don’t get it 

NTA THO NTA… hubby is a walking red flag with that behaviour NTA. I literally just said “WTF” out loud. Don’t deal with this by yourself. It will deteriorate to an abusive (emotional or otherwise) mess. Get a counsellor NOW. 

Have an emergency exit strategy. Better to have it and not need it, than not have it and want it. 

In my opinion you absolutely need it. NTA NTA - he is a grown man who can warm up his dinner. Your at home with two small children who depend on you to do everything for them There we go with that 'you don't do nothing around the house' mentality. Whenever I hear that the first thing that comes to my mind is to stop doing everything you usually do so that person can understand what it really means to not do anything around the house,

&#x200B;

Imagine the stories your husband tells to his buddies....they've probably got in his ear about who runs the house and those are the types of people you should steer clear from.

You are NTA!!! You stood your ground and you should keep doing it. I know your husband has a grueling job AND you do too! I haven't heard one thing about what your husband do to help out with HIS kids. That's more of a job than anything.

&#x200B;

Not trying to give advice to break up a marriage but you let your husband know you will not be waking up at odd hours of the day just to feed him. He's an adult. Just as it's his job to save lives, he's more than capable of feeding himself...

&#x200B;

When he said he almost passed out from hunger I would've told him to try some life saving techniques to keep that from happening. Yeah, it's petty but that struck a nerve in me. NTA 

Leave this man, he is abusive. This is not about food. This is about control. Run, do not walk. I agree with everyone. I just wanted to add OP-

When the fuck is eating a chore?? Only when your wife won’t do it for you?? This is seriously concerning behavior, OP. Being the working partner does not give one license to turn their nose up at any remaining household work, be it childcare or providing a meal here and there. I hope you choose to address this in a big way, and demand therapy. This is not a dynamic you want to pass to your kids. NTA. Also he is calling you petty but he’s the one being so petty as to go to sleep hungry to prove a point. What’s wrong with him - did he never learn how to use a microwave ? NTA. I would say fuck that guy, but he deserves ZERO pleasure Let him die of hunger. You will be bytter off. NTA. OP, call your mother and tell her this story. 

NTA Do NOT go to couples counseling with this man. Go to counseling on your own and make a safety plan to get yourself and your children away from him. 

Read Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft and The Lifesaving Divorce by Gretchen Baskerville for a Christian perspective. 

In couples counseling, abusers often manipulate the counselor and/or the therapeutic relationship to inflict further abuse.

ETA: https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/create-a-safety-plan/ NTA: he can handle the microwave. Sounds like my husband, rude and sarcastic. You are literally being emotionally abused.

NTA. He sounds like a drama Queen NTA. Are you sure you're in a healthy relationship? NTA. It's like a cat screaming and refusing to eat because it can see the bottom of its food bowl and wants you to give it more, if that cat was a grown-ass human adult who should know better.
OP, this man took an oath to love, care for, and respect you. What is he doing to uphold that vow? You’re NTA. He sounds toxic and you deserve better. Be pettier. Ok i may not be a parent or have a job but my parents work the same job in a different country (near ours) they come home late around 7 or 8 o'clock and still after getting scratches, hurt, working non stop they cook their OWN dinner, my solution to this is to tell him to text or call you 5-9 minutes before he comes and you already just need to reheat it. This guy is responsible for saving lives, but can't push a button on a microwave?! I bet his work partner absolutely loves having this lazy shit bag as a partner.  NTA. This is a terrible environment for you and your children to be in. Kick him to the curb. You're worth more than being a 24-hour maid that he can fuck when he wants to. NTA, this is abusive from him. You are definitely not the asshole. You are also working so hard to raise 2 kids and take care of yourself at the same time Oh dear sweet girl.. What an effing AH of a guy you married there!! Really sorry to say so, but that attitude and behaviour is just not right and normal in a healthy relationship. He basically treats you like a servant, not an equal partner. You should be best friends with your spouse. Doesn’t sound like he treats you as such. Even after you made sure he had meals ready at any time and - I’m guessing here - you take care of all things involving child caring, as well as cleaning, cooking, shopping, laundry etc and all house chores?



I know most will tell you to just leave the mf’er, and I don’t disagree. But I’ve been there myself, and I know it’s just not that easy. We didn’t even have kids. 



So. My advice is (if you can’t leave him) to see him as the source of income only. Insist on him heating up the meals you prepared (he’ll learn quickly if he’s truly hungry).                       
Spend every free moment you have to either educate yourself or work from home. Purpose being not to be totally dependent on him financially.                      
Network, interact with others, both friends and family, and be straight forward about how your home life is. Tell everyone the truth, and listen carefully to the feedback you get. I know you’re busy with kids and household, but even if your free time is just 10 minutes a day, don’t spend them knitting or binging tv or whatever’s your thing. Connect with people, rebuild yourself. 



I don’t need to tell you this guy doesn’t deserve you or all you do for him. You know that.                     
When the time is right and you feel strong enough and have a support system in place if you need it (most people do), you take your kids and leave.                    
It is so hard at first, and you will doubt yourself all the time. But when you’re through that weird mourning period, you’ll realise your life is better than ever, and you will not ever doubt if it was the right decision.


Oh, and not unimportant:                      
You are not doing your kids a favour by staying with a man like that. A little girl will grow up thinking this is how she should be treated, and a little boy will grow up thinking that is how he should treat the girls/women he meet later in life. 



NTA NTA, I work in a restaurant, and i live alone. my flat's a mess because i don't really have the energy to tidy up on account of the fact that my job is exhausting.

i still find the energy to slam a ready meal in the microwave though, or make some oven fries etc. NTA and your husband is acting like a piece of erhmmm.... Dejection? Well anyway you are in the clear here he is not. NTA NTA NTA NTA, please for the love of god leave him, it is not a safe environment for you or your children. This is abuse. If he can’t even reheat dinner himself without resulting to the extreme he has a problem, it also seems like he doesn’t acknowledge how hard you work. Being a stay at home mom is a serious job and it’s hard, you need your sleep and the fact he even considers it your task to give him food just shows how much he doesn’t respect you, I’m so sorry you are in this situation but please get out before he gets violent NTA.  You're not a SAHM with 2 kids.  You're a SAHM with 3 kids, the eldest one being the most needy.  I really question how this dude is an ambulance driver taking care of all kinds of sick & injured people but is too weak or stupid to REHEAT his own meals.  How does this caveman wipe his own a$$ if you are not there to do it for him?  I agree with CTDV8R - this is all about control & respect. Your husband is being a petty, inconsiderate asshole. Feel free to show him this thread. I’m the time it took him to wake you up he could have heated up his dinner. Sorry your husband is such an asshole OP. But you're not cooking his food! And you're the woman! Next you'll make the kids be gay cos you're not showing them how caveman works, and and then you'll be having an affair and he'll be living in a cardboard box under a bridge and it all starts with *doing his own dinner!* /s Bruh. I’m a temporary sahm with just my 7 month old (we also have 7, 9, and 14 but their care is much different). 

I rarely even cook, and I know when my husband will be home because he works regular business hours. This shit (having a baby) is HARD. But even if it wasn’t… I can’t fathom someone demanding I do things for them. Throw away the whole man. NTA, but… this is so much bigger than that. What a toxic controlling weirdo. 100% NTA. 
Your husband doesn’t have any respect for you! 
Massive 🚩 🚩 🚩 NTA
If he is willing to go get professional help with you maybe this marriage can work if he changes. If he doesn't I would look at taking your kids and leaving. Start evaluating all his behaviour and see if more is abusive. Dood.  I work 12 hour days and come home and make dinner for my whole family.  And then take care of other shit.  NTA, but your husband is. NTA. You made him the meal already, he can freaking put it in the microwave himself. You are not his servant. Shouting at you over this and then giving you the silent treatment is abusive, and also extremely immature, behavior.

My father was a farmer. It was just him, my grandfather, and two part-time employees handling the whole operation. He worked hard for long hours. My mom would make him meals he could microwave or meals that just waited in the crock pot for him all the time, because we didn’t always know when he’d be home. He never once complained. Not once. Because he knew it was unreasonable to expect my mother to be making him a full-course dinner at 10pm after she worked 8 hours, took us to our after school activities, fed us and did dishes, did our homework with us and got us to bed.

Being a stay at home Mom is your job. You take care of two very young kids all day, keep the whole house clean, make meals for everyone, probably are the one getting up when the baby cries at night, etc. He’s devaluing your hard work and treating you like a slave and that’s not ok. NTA, it wouldn’t even have to be about food it was about literally anything. All about the control. Sadly this reminds me of my dad and growing up he did this EXACT same thing. Except my mom was the bread winner out working on top of it, I still will never understand how she did it all and still does honestly. I wish you the best and stay strong, you’re not alone! 💜🙏🏼 Congrats on the reveal of your third child! Now run for the hills. >I know how hard he works

Taking care of 2 small children (one under 1 years old) is just as much work imo, reheating premade meals is incredibly simple and fast, and a great solution to the problem you thought you had. Like others have said, it's not about the meals, it's about control.

Your husband had absolutely no right forcing you awake just to throw a plate in the microwave and push a few buttons, he's the one being petty by 'starving' himself just to be controlling.

I hope you force him to seek some professional help, or do something to change the situation for the better So basically, you have 3 children.  NTA. NTA at all. You’re not his wife in his eyes, you’re his servant. Hate is a very strong word so I’m not going to use it, but I VERY MUCH DISLIKE YOUR HUSBAND on your behalf. NTA. 

The good news is that he hasn’t hit you…yet. But he will, eventually. Because he’s very, very abusive. None of what he is doing is loving or caring. Please protect yourself and your children. NTA NTA - He is abusive. He wakes you up to make him food?!?! If an SO of mine expected me to be on call 24/7 as his personal slave, I would start hysterically laughing and that would be followed up with an immediate breakup or divorce. ur getting taken advantage of He's made himself almost pass out from hunger from being a needy selfish dick.

Waking you up just to press a button on a microwave is ridiculous.  You did enough by doing all the meal prep, ensuring all he had to do was put his food in the microwave, heat and eat.

Give him a can of baby food, toddler sized spoon and tell him to open wide and force feed him the contents, if that's the level of micromanagement he demands.

NTA.  He's having a strop.  Someone needs to be the adult here, so react appropriately. OP. Please heed this advice from all these people. This relationship won't get better, and you might need to leave him. He doesn't respect you. You're an object to him. What would he do if he lived alone? Would he starve? I bet he would find something to eat. He is lucky you were nice enough to make him something. He just wants to control you. I would pack the kids up, and leave for one or two days. Don’t leave him any meals that he can simply heated up. When he has to cook an entire meal maybe he will be appreciate what you do for him. NTA. 

There is nothing to be gained staying in this relationship. He won't change, this level of contempt for you is a dead end. 

All the lovely posters saying, ""perhaps if you explained to him how hard you work 24/7 he might understand and not abuse you anymore"", are good-intentioned, but pretty naive. 

You could waste the next decade of your one life, trying to coach a guy out of verbally abusing you for no reason, hoping somehow he will see how unfair he is being, see the light and not be abusive anymore.  

More likely, this treatment will break you down till you accidentally start to accept this, hide this from others and normalise & model this horror show of disrespect to your kids. 

You might also find yourself lashing-out in similar ways or burning with petty passive aggression when you're too scared to say what you really mean.  This would be such a tragic tragic environment to waste your life away within.  And also so tragic for your kids to see, internalise & normalise thinking of you (and their own future partners) like a worthless servent they can terrorise at will.  

You deserve so much more. This guy low-key hates you.  No lovingly explaining how hurtful or irrational this is, will change it. You are made for so much and there will be so many other paths you can take away from him and his cold mircowave dinners. NTA. 
You’re in an abusive relationship and he’s 800% an AH. I hope you can see that. I was in one too and it still affects my life, even 10 years later and it definitely negatively affected my children. NTA. This isn't about him not wanting to reheat dinner, this is about him wanting all of the control in your relationship. Being a sahm is a full time job, especially when you have an infant, he doesn't understand that which is a huge 🚩. NTA. 

You work all day taking care of the house, the kids and him. He works 40 hours a week (likely) and he expects you to work 24/7? Not okay. You deserve a break. And re-heating his own dinner isn't a chore. It's a basic task. 

It seems like he just wants to control you. Very concerning. NTA and obviously your husband doesn't appreciate how difficult it is to care for two very young children. It infuriates me when men think all women do who stay home with kids is sit around watching tv. Your husband appears to be VERY self-centered thinking that heating up a homemade meal is out of the question. The last comment he made to you is reminiscent of what abusers tell their SO.. my behavior is all your fault and it won't get better. I'm really sorry for your situation but he thinks his job and even HE have more value than you and your children. So sorry NTA. Your husband is abusive and is using his career as an excuse to be shitty to you. I am a paramedic that works long shifts and I would never treat my husband this way. I am responsible for ensuring I get enough to eat at work and when I get home it is not my husband's responsibility to care for me. I would be over the moon and incredibly grateful if he pre-made food for me to heat up. You need to sit and have a serious discussion with your husband but honestly, it sounds like he treats you very poorly and I would be reevaluating my marriage if it was me. You deserve better. Good lord. And he’s in a job that requires level headedness and compassion?  Yikes! NTA Lady. Your husband is a dick. I am a SAHM. My husband comes home from working long hours and helps me cook, clean and take care of the kids. He also takes the kids so that I can get self care time and is currently doing the laundry because it's my day off.

 NTA

Your husband needs to get his ish together. Just because he is working outside the home doesn't mean he can't help in the home especially with a baby!! Fucking LEAVE him. Holy shit. NTA but I do have a question.  What was he doing in the hour between you going into the bedroom and when he came in?  I'm willing to be he reheated his dinner and ate it.  Top comment has it right.   it's not about the dinner, it's about control.  If he was about to ""pass out from hunger"" he wouldn't have the strength to yell about it.  Ridiculous, childish behavior. NTA
Also, OP, sounds like you might be better off as a single parent. It sure beats being a single parent AND a slave to an adult. NTA “So, your honor, that’s when I hit him upside the head with the cast iron pan.” If my husband woke me up to turn on the microwave, he would be getting divorce papers for dinner. NTA. My dad still cooks food for himself and doesn't need me (15f) to cook for him. Your husband needs to get his shit together. NTA at all or in any world. I hope OP recognizes this behavior as the manipulation that it is. He seems to be on a power trip, and he is hurting OP and the kids with it.

I am struck by the use of the word ""chore"" here. How is seeing to your own sustenance a ""chore?"" Especially after your wife went out of her way to pre-make said sustenance for you? Oh friend, I’m sorry you are going through this. I did too. My ex husband is a Ff/paramedic and has a side job. He works 24 on 48 off, when off he often has a side job. 

We share 5 kids. 

I am severely chronically ill. I’d have to sign out of hospital AMA to take care of the kids if I couldn’t find childcare and he needed to work. I was expected to have dinner done at 6, the house clean, deal with any and all kid stuff. Even if I had a 104.7 temp. 

After a while I insisted on marriage counseling.  Our therapist, after a few sessions pulled me aside and if you don’t get out of this marriage you will die. 

I’m divorced now- and re-married. How incredibly it feels to be in a loving marriage can’t be over stated. 

Don’t take this OP. Try counseling for yourself and marriage counseling if you like. You deserve better. Is this how you want your kids to see a marriage? They are watching and learning. Yikes. NTA… NTA

Yes he’s worked a long shift, but so have you. This is a great solution to the problem. If he had heated the food himself he would have got dinner a lot quicker than first yelling for you and having an argument about it. 

This is about control and his sense of superiority. You do not exist to serve him. He can feed himself or starve. Say it with me class: YOU NEED TO LEAVE!

NTA. Normally I would suggest talking or counseling to mediate your relationship, but waking you up with yelling when you have two tiny kids who LITERALLY can not take care of themselves in any way, just awful. I’m sure this is not the peak of his self centered or controlling antics. I would wager he like having a wife that is a sahm because he controls the income and the boundaries of what you can and cannot do, making it incredibly difficult for you to leave him. This is just an observation from experience. I hope you have good family and friends for support! This is just straight up abusive, controlling behavior. NTA. OP, just because you are a SAHM does not mean you do not have a job. That being said, let me give you some insight into the paramedic world.

I work in the ED. The ambulance personnel do not starve. They stop at fast food restaurants, share our ED snacks, buy meals in the hospital cafeterias, and heat their food in our areas. Those of us who work long shifts, (12-24hrs), come prepared. We know how to keep sandwiches on hand, and we know which places can get us food on the fly.

Your man is just bullying you. Take care and love your babies. If he comes in yelling about being hungry, tell him that it's his choice. The food is there. Heat it, Leave it. My mom told me when I first got married, ""Gnat, don't start a habit that you don't want to continue."" You already have two children. You don't need another. Be well.

Edit:    NTA....not at all....just a strong woman I work entire shifts nonstop as well, no breaks, sometimes 12 hours at a time with no break. And I make my own dinner. You, OP, I assume clean house, prepared those dinners, and have to take care of two very, very young kids. His “SAHM” do nothing all day attitude is atrocious, not to mention the very obvious fact that he’s acting like a 4 year old. If he wants a servant to reheat his meals cause he’s too entitled with his superman job to open a fridge and press a button on a microwave, which BTW takes less effort than actually eating the damn food, he should hire one. 

But what you have in a husband is an entitled little spoiled brat with an ego the size of Mt Everest, snd a complete disregard for anything you do for him or have done for him. 

This idea that, because he’s an ambulance driver, he needs to be waited on hand and foot when he gets home is straight out of the dark ages. He’s waving this badge around to get you to do everything for him and he has zero appreciation. Frankly as a man, he makes me sick. Once again, another parent messes up a kid’s head with foolish ideas. And his going to bed hungry because he would rather spend time fighting than pushing a button on a meal you prepared is beyond immature. This is one of the more disrespectful louses I’ve read on here.

If you want to stay with him for the kids, you two need couples therapy instantly. If he doesn’t want to do it then I recommend making no meals for him and letting him starve to death. Time for you to stop treating him like he’s Jesus of Nazareth, spending 23 hours a day healing the sick. He’s doing a job that can be performed just as well by what he’s treating as the inferior sex. Sorry you married this mouse. NTA, being a sahm is hard work.  This is abuse and disrespect - red flag. Social worker here. I see sooooooooo many red flags. As many others have said, this is not about food. This is about control. It most definitely could be considered abusive, and I'm worried. He may try to regain control in any way he can if he feels he is losing it. This could take the form of rape (marriage is not a green light for sex. Rape is still rape, even though you're married). It could take the form of limiting your access to money. It could take the form of removing your ability to contact people without him being present. 

I would recommend you come up with a safety plan. What are you going to do if those things happen? Do you have someone that you talk to every day that would be concerned if they don't hear from you? Let that person know that if they don't hear from you it may be because he's taken your phone and you need help. 

Maybe we're all wrong and this really is about food, but my experience tells me otherwise. Please stay safe. Obviously NTA. NTA

He can reheat his own damn dinner You are NTA.

I was in a relationship with a man like this for a short time. He was so charming at first. But as soon as he moved in, he began expecting to run the show. Because I made breakfast for us on a weekend, he expected me to lay out his clothes and the newspaper by his plate and cook a full breakfast every morning. Well, I worked full time, too, so when he told me this, I scoffed and he became enraged. He responded by throwing an apple at my head as hard as he could. Luckily, I ducked so he missed, but then I stood up, fully enraged myself. In the calmest voice ever, I informed him that if he ever laid a hand on me or my child, that I would kill him, and reminded him that I was armed and perfectly capable. He threw things and yelled and left the house for work.

I knew it was over in that moment.  Though it took a lot more drama, a restraining order, tons of horrible messages left on my answering machine, being chased through town trying to avoid him, etc. before he vanished to go find the ex he had abused before me. Her restraining order helped me to get my own. I had to move out of the area, but it was the smartest thing I ever did.

He will escalate. This is a warning you should heed. NTA and this is really awful, the shouting could’ve woken the kids too which is just beyond selfish. I hope tonight he comes in quietly and heats up his dinner like a normal, functioning adult. Serious red flag with this behaviour! In addition to the multiple people telling you to look closer at your relationship I would like to add that I live with my sister.

For the first 5 years we lived together, she was an EMT. For the last 2 of those years she was pulling double duty as a nursing student (which is an exhausting program all by itself, nevermind paired with 24 hr EMT shifts). She now works overnight as a nurse and has done so for the last 2 years.

Never once has she ever come home demanding a meal. She may be too exhausted to cook for herself  in which case she goes to be hungry and wakes up ravenous. Or if I've made something that can be eaten by 2 I'll leave some out for her to reheat (occasionally I'm able to do it for her). I've been WFH since 2020. At no point has she ever demanded that I HAVE to make her a meal, or reheat food for her. Pressing a button on a microwave takes .5 braincells and is something that even an exhausted nurse or EMT/Student can manage. 

Also, after graduating she spent her first year as a nurse in the ER of one of the largest hospitals in the city, which is one of our largest cities. And she still wasn't a bitch about food, in fact, because i was semi-high risk (asthmatic) she actually spent about 3 or 4 months in a hotel so she WOULDNT risk bringing covid home to me. 

Your husband has no excuse. And you should not let him get away with this. Being a SAHM is your more than full time WFH job. And if your husband doesn't understand or respect that he doesn't deserve you.

NTA. 
Oh honey he would fear the next time he ate anything of mine because I would tell him I absolutely dare you to eat it because I checked the life insurance policy and it’s paid up NTA NTA. Your husband's behavior is not okay. You are working hard too.

Speaking as a first responder, burn out is real. Your husband is working long hours and responding to emergencies. He is there for people on their worst days. This stress can wear on someone over time and can be difficult to not take home. Is this behavior something new or is this normal? If this is abnormal behavior for him it might be time to talk with him about seeking professional help. Mental health problems are fairly common amongst first responders. They can become worse over time or you might notice a sudden change in behavior. While it is never okay to lash out at family or friends, it might be a sign that there is something else going on internally. 

Good luck! NTA. When does YOUR shift end? When do you get a break? It sounds like you are always on duty or at the very least “on call.” You don’t deserve to be forced to live like that. Your time, your sleep, and your labor is NOT any less valuable than his and he needs to stop acting like it is. NTA.

He's a grown man and he can reheat his own food or eat it cold.

You shopped; you cooked; you cleaned; you looked after the children.

 He has no reason to expect you to get up and reheat his dinner, unless he is spoiled.  If so, it's about time for a reality check. If he was not being an ass about it, I'd suggest making loving little casseroles that can be reheated in the oven instead of a microwave, so that the food has that nice crisp.

Instead, I find myself telling you to choose between marriage counseling and divorce, which makes me really sad because I believe marriage can be wonderful when it's done right. I hope there's a way to heal this for you all. 

NTA NTA NTA You have three children and only morally responsible for the younger two. This was all about control, not hunger. You didn't obey and now he is livid. Please be careful. You are NTA in any way shape or form. Your husband has some issues that either reared their ugly head last night or have been going on for awhile. Please talk to someone you trust. NTA your husband is a dick. I know his job is hard, I know people in the same field, however I'd say its still easier than being a stay at home mom with 2 young kids. I don't care how tired he is surely he can operate a microwave.

You're not his maid. I hate him. Pressing 3.00 start. Is super fucking hard tho. And then waiting 3 mins. For it to heat up... then a minute to cool down. Pre made meals under 10 mins is ridiculous. /s . Dude better be careful or he will end up doing a lot more than just heating his dinner in his very own bathelor apartment. NTA he can reheat his food. It’s made and available. NTA. His behavior is terrifying. This is where it starts and will continue to escalate. Please get out now with your kids before that happens. NTA. 

I agree with what everyone else said and just wanna add: if he's too exhausted to reheat food, he can eat it cold. Any cooked meal can be safely eaten cold. 

Not feeding himself when he's ""hungry enough to almost pass out"" is irresponsibility on his part, and I'd expect someone working in the medical field to know better. But he was fine when he was driving home, he had enough energy to yell and argue. This guy's just trying out power play, you did absolutely nothing wrong. NTA. 

What your husband did was very unhealthy for everyone involved. I would think, that he wanted to assert control and have his expectations fulfilled. Now, this was a very bad move to do - Stating it just to reinforce that point - but I am very curious as to why he expects this act of 'prepared dinner' from you when he knows the logistical problem with his work and your children. 

There is something that has made him want to 'take a stand' on the dinner situation; and it does not have to be the stereotypical husband/wife work division. 

Now again, it's not a good idea to give your spouse the silent treatment. But if he himself cannot explain/put into words, why he is so stubborn on this point... Then there might be something very interesting going on here.  

I suggest you have a neutral professional look into your relationship. Clearly there is a level of mismatched expectations and miscommunication. Nta, op this is crazy behavior and you need to run. NTA. He's just manipulating you. Don't let him do that -- your job is more than a 12 hour shift, you're already taking care of *his children* (also your children, never forget that) as well as *his home*, he can spend five minutes deciding which meal to pull from the refrigerator and put it in the microwave. Going hungry for five minutes or going hungry for a whole night, which is the better option? And yet he chose to go hungry for the whole night. *He chose to go hungry for a whole night.* *He chose.* That's his responsibility now. And you need to talk to your Mom about all of this, and tell her that he's emotionally abusing you, and ask if she can help you get away from him if he's not willing to change for the better. NTA!

Add me to Team Husband Needs to Behave like a Grown-Ass Man. I have never *until now* read a post on Reddit and thought “you should leave this man”…. OP from this post alone I can tell this guy is abusive or getting there. Leave. Wow.  What exactly do you see in this man?  What is with women marrying babies?  He’s an abuser.  He is dangerous.  He needs help and so do you NTA. Not gonna mince words.  You are being abused. 

i have been where you are. 

I'm also where i am now, with a man who works hard all day and then immediately asks me what kind of help i need from him. 

it doesn't have to be this way for you

i might be overstepping but i have to assume that this isn't the only way he tries to control you or tantrum you into doing what he wants. 

he's acting like a spoiled child over a few minutes in the microwave. 

your babies are watching this. 

I'm not saying any of this to shame you but to motivate you. counseling might help. if he won't go, go by yourself. but this isn't sustainable. NTA 

My brother is an EMT his wife is a SAHM while she completes school while taking care of my niece. Even after shifts my brother still takes care of his own kid and makes his own food he doesn’t expect anything from his wife that he can’t do on his own, he doesn’t yell at her or guilt trip her over anything. Don’t let this man treat you like his maid. He’s making himself go hungry when all he could do is get the pre made food and heat it up in the microwave he’s not your 3rd child he’s a grown man that can handle taking care of himself. NTA, but wow are you married to one! Holy hell, that guy seriously sucks. He doesn't think much of you at all, definitely doesn't respect you! Don't back down on this. If he goes to bed hungry, that's his fault. NTA. He expects you to be some 50s housewife at all hours because he doesn’t respect that you have a job, like 3 of them actually. I’d do some seriously examining of this relationship because you might be better off not married

and PS he didn’t almost pass out from hunger etc because of you. In the time it took him to yell and wake you up etc he could have heated the food and been eating it. He choose not to eat so he could bully you I don't like his childish ass one bit. He does not see you as a person. NTA NTA!!

Is he controlling in other ways too? I had an ex boyfriend- way before I had kids, while I still worked a full time job and everything, that for some reason EXPECTED me to wash all his laundry and make him lunch for work every day- without asking me or anything- because I had been nice and done it a few times. He got mad and started complaining because he woke up late for work one day, after staying up late playing video games, and he had no clean work clothes and I hadn't made him lunch. I didn't know he didn't have clean clothes and he never asked me to check or anything. And he used to go out for lunch with his shift regularly. 

I literally laughed at him, reminded him that he wasn't a child and I had things I needed to do as well and that I was under no obligation to treat him like he was a toddler. It was a very long time before I did him any favors like that again. His childlike behavior is part of why he is an ex.

You are a sahm with a preschooler and a baby!! A lot of babies still wake up in the middle of the night at 6mo! There's no way at all I would be getting out of bed to tend for a grown man unless he was like injured or something . Especially since you ALREADY made him food and all he needed to do was reheat it?!?!?! 

He CHOSE not to eat. And he is trying to manipulate your emotions so he can control you into doing what he wants. 

If this is a random one off thing where he had a super shitty night and he acted like a jerk....ok. if he apologizes, admits the crappy behavior, and never repeats it again. But if there are other red flags......I'd recommend counseling at the least. NTA, op get out, this is controlling and abusive. NTA. 

I get SAH relationships can be a little different, with the SAH person being in charge (usually) of more of the housework. My BF and I do something similar (though no kids so it’s 10x easier) because he’s still in college and I WFH. So I take care of the house, which primarily involves making him meals. 

He has never, not once, screamed at me, woken me up, or interrupted something vital I was doing (in your case, taking care of his children) because he needs food. He gets hungry to the point he’s going to pass out, he makes a sandwich, a bowl of cereal, etc. Heck, there are even days where I tell him “hey I don’t really feel like cooking” and he’ll offer to cook or make me a sandwich and we’ll just do easy stuff. 

NTA, and please try to get some help for yourself. Your husband seems very manipulative and childish at the bare minimum. 

You’re a SAHM, not a slave. Who are these people (your husband) who act like children!?

&#x200B;

From my perspective this man does not respect that what your doing while he is at work is also work!!! Raising 2 small kids, keeping the house clean, and preparing his meals is work.

&#x200B;

And for him to expect you to wake up to heat up a f#@king meal is ridiculous. You are already taking the time to make him these meals and he can not take the minutes it would take to heat them...instead interrupt your sleep to do it. 

&#x200B;

Does he think your his slave, mom or wife?

&#x200B;

NTA Boy, he's gonna get mighty hungry when you leave.  NTA nta.  hun, throw the whole man out. you deserve better. MAIDS deserve better. Waking you up to throw something in the microwave for him? unacceptable NTA I think I'd just start buying those premade salads and throw them in the fridge. He doesn't want to reheat stuff, looks like he's eating rabbit food NTA. My BIL is a first responder and I lived with him and my sister for several years. There was never an ounce of this sort of behavior exhibited. If he wanted food, he picked it up, or made it, or *calmly discussed* the preparation of a meal with his wife. 

Your husband is abusive and I hope you find safety and peace.   A big sign of emotional abuse is them making you do things that inconvenience you. Like a guy who's girlfriend makes him come down from their apt to walk her to the door everytime she comes home no matter what he's doing. Or I know someone who's ex would ask her to please leave her job and go to the ex's apt all the time because he thought he left his iron on, or he forgot his lunch. 

  Its usually something that isn't outrageous. It's not a gross or repellant. Yet. It starts with requests that just, inconvenience you. They're trying to make you prove yourself by going out of your way. Take a picture with a spoon on your head right now. I know you don't like mayo but just please, for me bite this tunafish sandwich.  

  Next thing you know you can't eat, sleep, shower, move or think without permission. And it's not because they hit you, but they make every disobedience a really big deal. They scream, cry, ignore, throw things, end the relationship. All because you wouldn't just take one bite, text back right away, pick up their dry cleaning on your day off from a place right next to their job. Here I was all set to lay down the all precious ""YTA"" but then your husband acted like a spoiled brat.  I mean, Jesus... Using a microwave ain't all that hard, even when you're tired.

NTA.  Soooo NTA.  I'd be looking at all those red flags and rethinking your future if I were in your shoes. Divorce. Dude some many red flags. No no no. It's only going to get worse Op, honey. I’m gonna put this a way you could understand. Because us saying that you deserve more might now get through so, imagine it was your children. Imagine your child has a partner that treats them the way he treats you. Imagine your child is looking after small children that need constant attention and is exhausted. Imagine your child has fallen asleep and is woken up by their partner screaming at them because they are too immature to heat up a meal, something a child can do. Think about it. Think about it long and hard. What would your advice be to your child? Your kid has come to you and is saying “he yelled mum. He woke me up and screamed at 11pm and demanded I heat up his food. And when I refused. He made me feel guilty by saying that my actions meant he was starving. Mum, he isn’t talking to me. Did I do something wrong?” Your child. 
I imagine your advice would be, something like “you did nothing wrong, he is being manipulative, he is immature and is treating you wrong.” 

I am also using your kids as an example because I know you will want what’s best for them. Children recreate the relationships they see, if they see how he treats you, they think that is normal. And when their partner treats them wrong. They won’t see a problem. 

If it was your child, what would you want them to do. NTA. Having just one child and keeping house was work. You have three. You may not get paid for your work, but you definitely work harder than he does. If it’s too much trouble for him to let you get the sleep you need and set the microwave for two minutes, he has serious issues. I agree with another commenter: this is a control move on his part. NTA - I sincerely hope (for your sake) that this is not the typical behaviour your husband demonstrates and merely just a result of a stressful day / not thinking clearly. Not making any excuses for him, but rather from being a parent myself and being well aware of how stressful your family life must be right now given both of your current occupations (SAHM, Ambulance Driver - both very stressful jobs).

If this IS his typical behaviour, please seek marriage counselling immediately Cab you imagine needing an ambulance and getting this asshole as your driver?

NTA, OP, but your husband *sucks* [National Domestic Violence Hotline](http://www.thehotline.org): learn the signs of intimate partner violence.  Doesn't have to be physical to be inappropriate. Get a job ASAP. He didn't respect your homemaking and parenting labor. If you don't believe all the commenters warnings, at least having employment will give you, ""I'm working, too!"" respect.

And income for if gets worse. LEAVE HIM. NTA at all. He’s being a fucking baby and I’m deeply concerned for you because he seems to think you’re there to be his wife, mommy, and maid. NTA. My husband and I are both cardiac nurses who work 12 hour shifts (sometimes up to 16 hours). I'm on maternity leave right now looking after our baby and 3 year old and my husband absolutely does NOT expect dinner when he gets home because he knows how much work it is taking care of kids. If I have a particularly good day with the kids I make him dinner when I have time and he reheats it when he gets home and he always says ""Thank you"". A lot of the time I'm too busy with the kids to make a good meal for dinner and he makes his own. He's never ever complained about that because he knows how busy it is taking care of the kids. 

As soon as he walks in the door from work it's 50/50 for chores and parent duties. 

OP: I would absolutely book regular therapist appointments immediately and if he didn't apologize immensely AND agree to regular couples therapy so he could learn about communication and respect AND turn his behaviour around completely - I'd get a divorce otherwise. Good luck OP! NTA

For your kids and your sake, please make an exit strategy ❤ Are you sure he’s your husband and not your third child? Because he sounds like a toddler crying about not getting their way. You are NTA. You literally work 24/7. No days off. He is perfectly capable of putting a plate in the microwave himself. He is gaslighting you and being narcissistic and it’s gross. He is also manipulating you and all of this tossed together forms a strong case of emotional abuse. Look it up. You will probably find yourself checking most every box. This is NOT okay. You deserve to be treated better. Him forcing you to wake up after being with the children all day and all night is damaging to your own mental health. Also, he clearly does not care about the kids very much because he was willing to wake them up while he threw a tantrum. He needs a reality check and you need someone who understands the depth of being a SAHM. Because it’s definitely not all sunshine and rainbows. It’s hard. Your main source for conversation is a 3 year old, you don’t get to ‘clock out’ from being a mom. 
Yes his job is important and I’m sure he works hard but he is being a sexist pig expecting you to wait on him hand and foot. Especially considering he’s a grown man. 
Just stop. Stop making him dinner. Stop getting up when he throws a tantrum, stop allowing him to walk all over you and make you question if you’re actually in the wrong for refusing to be woken up just to reheat his dinner. Because you’re NOT in the wrong. At all. This is not the way a marriage or partnership should be. 
Please recognize your worth. I'd leave him OP

NTA

Call your mother up and ask if you can come for a very long visit.  Then you and the children can go and stay there.  Also  you may want to call his parents and talk to his mother.  Ask her if he had any problems as a child with say using a microwave and heating up his food.  then put him on ignore.  Talk to your mother, talk to his mother, if you are on good terms with her, but him, let him deal with being ignored.  Bet after a few days he is wanting you to come back home, but only after he agrees to individual and couples counseling.  (Which is what he clearly needs.) NTA, is your husband Fred Flintstone? Shouting for a meal the minute he opens the door. NTA

he's going to use his job as an excuse to not contribute anything but money and expect to be waited on hand and foot while denying you human dignity nta. divorce lawyer asap. microwaves aren't hard to use. NTA, what would he do if you didn’t exist? I assume he would still have to go to work. Would the poor thing wither away and die? The guy is an idiot and you deserve better. You guys don't need therapy. You can't fix this. He thinks because he works and you take care of the home he owns you. You are supposed to do what he tells you when he tells you. That can't be fixed. He most likely wouldn't go to therapy anyways. Do you have family or friends you can stay with? Has he always been like this or did it recently start? If he's always like this why did you have kids with him? NTA, but know your own worth. NTA!

Did you marry my sister's narcissistic ex husband.

He weaponizing his incompetence and waving every red flag around.

He is an adult.  He can heat his own damn dinner.  You are not his maid or servant. NTA. Jesus! Your husband can expect dinner to be made if you are a SAHM, but him being unable/unwilling to heat it himself is so infuriating. What a fucking baby. Even bread and cheese should be sufficient cooking if you have had a busy day with the kids and whatever. NTA 
HE is being a fucking child. HE needs to grow the fuck up. HE can reheat his own dinner. If he has the energy to scream at you from another room and wake you up he has the energy to put a fucking plate in the microwave. He’s not going to pass out of hunger, what the fuck. 
He can do it on his own, it’s not even a chore. He is screaming at you, waking you up when you’re supposed to be sleeping. And also potentially waking up the kids.
I’m sorry to tell you this but this is abusive behavior. He’s showing signs of being a narcissistic asshole. I really think you should get out of that relationship for your own sake for your children. They deserve a better dad. Fuck him and his self righteous attitude! It's not an unreasonable request. NTA.  He's TA, and a misogynistic one at that. 

You BOTH work hard.  Yes, his job is important and he's the breadwinner, but you ALSO work hard all day, and your job, taking care of your beloved CHILDREN is JUST as important as his job.

He's the one being petty and immature.  You're a stay-at-home MOTHER, not a stay-at-home WIFE.  Your job and priority is taking care of your KIDS and YOURSELF, because if you can't take care of YOURSELF, you can't take care of your KIDS.  

If you have anything left over energy-wise at the end of the day/week, you can expend some of that energy on your husband, if you want to.  But he cannot expect this of you.  He's a big boy and he can microwave his own damn dinner.  

I wouldn't even pre-make anything for him anymore.  Let him fend for himself.  

Personally, I wouldn't stay with someone who thought of me like a slave, who can't lift literally one damn finger to punch in some numbers on the microwave to help himself.  He sounds pretty useless husband/father-wise.  You don't need him. NTA-it’s shocking to me how many grown men are unable to get themselves fed. NTA. You are in an abusive relationship. You’re def NTA, but it sounds like you’re about to be a DV survivor, if you aren’t already. SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR KIDS 🚩 Of course you need to do it.  You're the wife!

Kidding.  NTA.  But why do you even need to ask reddit?  Tell him to FO and leave if necessary. NTA. You poor woman. Your husband is a dick. NTA 

I would recommend not feeding him anymore and that problem will apparently take care of itself. You deserve better, I hope you know that. I think you probably do. Definitely NTA. Being a stay at home mom (especially for such young kids) is a full time job too, and you did your part by preparing it in the first place. Reheating food typically takes 5 minutes or less, you took 2 days to meal prep for him. Preparing food (including reheating) isn't even a chore, it's a basic need. You've done your part and you've done it well :) NTA. Wtf am I readsing here? Sounds like you have the tougher job. NTA. Your husband is a grown adult who is perfectly capable of pushing a few buttons on a microwave. I work 12-14 hour shifts over nights and manage to feed myself without expecting my housemates to do so. Your husband strikes me as a very entitled AH. Don't give in to him. nta
reheating your own supper isnt a chore. NTA. Your husband is behaving like a child, he is a grown man who starts shouting for a meal when he could just reheat it, you know, like even a teenager can do! And the fact that he didn't eat to make you feel bad about it it's such a manipulative low strike that I can't believe you guys have been together for so long (assuming it's long because of the 2 kids). This is how the person who supposedly loves you treats you?

NTA NTA - this is abuse. Y’all need couple’s therapy if this is someone you want to stay with. You don’t want your children growing up in a place where they are their mother treated like this. NTA, but honey, you have three kids, not two.  Just saying. He is an adult male,  He is responsible for himself.  If I was you, I would have taken every bit of food in the fridge that I prepared and tossed it on the floor.  Tell him, Now you can go hungry.   I would refuse to make ANY food for him at all.  Yes, he may ""work"" 24 hour shifts, they do get to sleep during that time.  It's not like he is always awake. 

He also is cruel.  He is waking you up to get him food.  Really look at his behavior and see if it isn't abuse.  Denying you rest, is abuse...it will only get worse. Don't give in. If he's capable of working he's capable of operating a microwave. How embarrassing for him to act this way. I'd let him heat his own dinner up again and if he doesn't do it let him starve. His choice. If he chooses to starve I'd stop making him dinner entirely- no sense wasting food especially because he doesn't appreciate the effort going in to it to make it. 

You're job with kids lasts 24/7. He gets breaks in between and to come home to a tidy house and well looked after kids. He needs to pull his finger out or finding himself suddenly single and having to clean, cook and run a place by himself. He should not be doing anything that involves helping people. If he’s able to do it to you, he’s doing it to his coworkers too. NTA. I agree with many comments here - this behaviour is NOT ok.  You went out of your way to make this dude meals that could be heated and eaten at any time of the day or night.  He is capable of heating his own food. This is not about the meals, as another commenter said, it’s about control. 

I was once married to a man like this.  He would throw temper fits if I went out without him, made plans without him, didn’t want to do exactly the same thing he wanted to do at any given time.  There was a federal election at one point and he insisted I vote the same as him with no regard to my personal views.  When I refused he stood outside of the voting booth and hollered  “You are my WIFE and as my WIFE you will do as I say!”   He would flip out like this over anything that he perceived to be a threat to his station as the ‘man’ of the house.  

You are not this man’s housekeeper or his caregiver. You should be, and deserve to be, viewed as his equal.  Some serious intervention needs to happen here.  If you can’t find a way to change things for you, please remember that your children are witnessing this and his behaviour will will become part of their perception of how to treat their own partners in the future.  You don’t want your little ones thinking this is how a marriage works.  

You don’t deserve to be treated this way. You are most definitely NTA. NTA. I’m a paramedic and I’d be so grateful to have food ready for me when I get home. Reheating is really low-effort. Your husband sounds like a real dick. Divorce babe, divorce NTA but your husband certainly is.  I wouldn't back down and would explain to him that you're not his servant, you're his wife and you don't get any time off, you work 24/7.  If he's too lazy to reheat a meal you took the time to make for him, then maybe you don't have time to even make his meals.  From now on, you will buy things for sandwiches and he can make it himself.  

If he continues this behavior, you may have to make a hard decision.  This is who he is, can you deal with this for the rest of your life?  Are you his servant or his wife that he supposedly loves?  Is this the family dynamic you want to show your little ones?  Boy or girl this is a horrible example of family.   Your husband doesn't appreciate or respect you and it's your choice, either refuse to take it or allow it to continue. >how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger  
>  
>he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this

Says he almost passed out from hunger and then goes to bed without eating.

SAHM is a full time job too. He is abusive and horrible, especially for thinking he has the right to yell and scream all of this at you in the middle of the night when you have two young children in the house.

Go stay with your mother for a few days. Take the kids. Lets see whether he actually passes out from hunger.

NTA Are you his wife or his slave? Sounds like he equates the two, which is hugely concerning to say the least. NTA. This behavior is scary. You can contact the National domestic abuse hotline for free. They have counselors and resources to help you leave safely. They’ll direct you to local free resources in your area. 

It’s either thehotline.org or 800-799-7233 or SMS text START to 88788 NTA. If you weren't there, by his logic, he would starve. I don’t understand why you’re with this guy. You are a sahm not his SLAVE!!! A lot of people don’t understand that and feel entitled you do stupid things like this for them. LEAVE Wtf did I just read???? If you were awake and not busy at that moment I would find it ok if he would ask nicely if you would reheat his dinner.. and even then you wouldn’t have to do it! But it was at night and you were sleeping???!?!?! He sounds evil.. that is crazy as fuck. NTA!!!! INFO: Does reheating the meal require collecting firewood and using a flint and steel to start a fire, or do you have a microwave or stove? NTA and please for the love of god let him read these comments. I absolutely respect the work he does and thank him for it, but he needs a good shaking if he's going to treat driving an ambulance like he's been slaving away in the mines all day. I can't BELIEVE he wakes you up to heat food up???? That is insanity and just plain disrespectful. I would stop doing everything or leave him to run the house alone on his off days because he clearly thinks very little of the work you do to support the family on your end. I am so sorry you have to deal with this and I honestly do not understand how you've put up with this behavior for so long. You are his WIFE not a servant. Like this isn't even something a mother would do for their child. I can’t get over the number of women who are abused by their spouses, and come here asking if they’re the AH. NTA

One has to wonder what he would do if he was single and had no kids? Would he sit in the living room shouting into the void? He would probably eat garbage takeout or frozen trash-food. He needs a reality check. NTA, regardless of what his job is this is abuse, do not tolerate it, tell him straight up that either he can reheat the pre made meals or go hungry but your not a maid and you don't ""work"" on demand.

If he chucks a nothing childish hissy fit have some divorce papers ready for when he gets home. NTA 
OP, I’m so, so upset just reading the way he dares to treat you. You do NOT deserves that. He should be thanking you very much and doing everything he can to help and please you. My fiancé is a fireman and a bodybuilder. He eats multiple meals a day, all of which he cooks and heats himself. He also cleans all the dirty dishes that he creates doing food prep.

You don't have a husband. You have a 3rd child that just isn't home all day. How could you possibly think that you are in any way in the wrong when he is clearly the problem? Do you want your children to grow up thinking this dynamic is acceptable? If he is unwilling to see the error of his ways and work on himself, you should seriously reconsider being married to this person. INFO: Why have you not yeeted this man into an active volcano. OP NTA

My bf snd I work 60 plus hour weeks. I do make the majority of the meals and make sure we both have breakfast, lunch, and dinner due to our long hours. I am good from 420 am to about 4 pm everyday. He is gone from 6 to 7 am. To 5 to 7 pm. If I do not feel like making our meals, he will step up or we get take out or trash food. And he tells me every day how much he appreciates me working so hard and making our meals. I truly enjoy making our food and taking care of him. 

He is in no way going to ever yell at me for telling him he has to reheat a pre-made meal. Girl, please reevaluate your situation, reread what you posted and whatever advice you would give to your son or daughter, take it. Communicating is key unless he can't or won't. I left a mentally exhausting and abusive marriage of ten years and the breath of fresh air I could finally breathe, made it all worth it. Let yourself only be treated how you would treat them. Your husband is lucky that you take care of the home, the kids, and make his meals. Please please please look at your situation and your children and how you as a partner should be treated. What would he do if he was single? Starve to death???? It is already extremely nice of you to prepare dinner ready to be reheated at any time !!! NTA Definitely NTA. If my dad had ever done any of this to my mom, no matter how old me and my siblings were, she'd have given him an at home vasectomy, (not literally, that's just the type she is, she don't take no shite).

You two definitely need some sort of couples counciling or something, idk, but he's trying to control you. At least you're own kids have an excuse for that sort of behavior, they're 3 and a baby, is your husband? NTA. I would suffocate my firefighter husband with a pillow if he pulled this nonsense. What an ass. NTA this guy sounds abusive. I mean, getting mad about needing to reheat your own dinner... How the heck did he survive without you ?!

My recommendation: move out asap. 🚩🚩🚩 NTA
I'm not saying he doesn't work hard, but most ambulance drivers are sitting around waiting for a job to come in.  I know because I was one.

Ask him if he wants to trade for a few years. You'll go work out the home, while he stays home and works more hours than anyone does outside of the home, just like you do now. NTA but those are some pretty severe red flags. This isn't about food it's about control. He is a full grown man. If he ""passes out from hunger"" that's on him. He knows how to heat up some food. This person is dangerous, and this will become physical if it's allowed to spiral. NTA but, quick reminder, 3 year olds don't tend to form a lot of solid memories but BOY HOWDY do they remember trauma.

Protect your kids.

BTW, mom standing up to abuse isn't the traumatic bit. It's their father turning into a raging monster when he can't get his way. 

You standing up to him will show that not only CAN you protect yourself and them from their father but you WILL protect them. NTA, does he want you to wipe his arse and dress him too? NTA, you're his wife not his mother/maid.

At the end of the day, he is responsible for his own health and choice to work in the profession he has chosen. For this specific situation, he is being unreasonable. NTA. OP, if you are in the U.S., here is the Domestic Abuse Hotline: https://www.thehotline.org/ NTA - I get that being a Healthcare worker is extremely stressful, I did it for 30 years. HOWEVER taking your stress out on your wife when you get home is not acceptable. By 11PM, any parent of a 3yr old and 6 month old is exhausted and if they are asleep when the other parent gets home, they should enjoy the peace and quiet to unwind not demand that the sleeping partner wake up and wait on them. The obvious (and yes, I know, childish solution) is to wake him up when the kids wake you up in the morning, demanding that he make breakfast because you have babies to change and feed.

Right now, you are probably both exhausted and at 11PM, should refuse to get into any discussion about whose job things are. Let him know that if food is ready in the fridge, you expect him, a grown man to be able to reheat it. If he can't figure it out, then you will teach him. If he pulls that crap again of coming into a quiet, sleeping house and yelling then there better be either blood or fire. If he wakes up sleeping children by yelling, then he gets to put them back to sleep.

Yes, you are a SAHM but that doesn't mean you don't need sleep and respect for your work. Doing what he did is tantamount to his partner in the truck taking off the O2 he has just put on the patient or worse, undoing the straps on a confused elderly patient that they are transporting. he was yelling because you wouldn’t heat up the food when your children were asleep???? what the hell. how little respect do you have to have for someone to make them wake up just so they can put something in the microwave for you? heating up your own food isn’t a chore, he just wants to control you. NTA. This has nothing to do with food. He’s playing a stupid game and he will win stupid prizes. Stand firm, op. NTA! OP - DEFINITELY NTA !
(He can save lives, but CANT operate a microwave ?!)
Bahhhh ha ha ha ha - bring your wife some flowers, tell her you love her and grow up pal, she’s not YOUR mom. OP…I’m so concerned for you. This is not okay. Even if the house isn’t clean and the food isn’t great-you tried!! The kids are alive and happy and fed and you are doing your best. Your name though…’throwawaySarah’…you are worth so much more than you give yourself credit for. Reading your name made my heart hurt. Do NOT let that immature excuse of a man hurt you for one more second emotionally. You are not his mom. You are not his slave. He is the AH. 100%!!! NTA - your husband is an demanding abusive jerk.  Figure out a way to get the hell out of there. NTA, there is a phrase 'cutting your nose off to spite your face' which sums his actions up.

Being a stay at home dad and someone who worked long shifts (upto 14hrs) involving lifting heavy equipment (25kg +)  I can honestly say that you are working harder than him. NTA

This ""man"" is acting like a literal 3 year old. 

Tell him to grow the hell up and act like an adult. You already have 2 children to take care of, you don't need a 3rd. I stopped reading after you called your husband an “ambulance driver.” Regardless about the context of this post, you should probably stop referring to him as an ambulance driver and started calling him a paramedic… NTA
This is abusive.
I'll bet there are a multitude of other ways he is abusive, but OP is only sharing this one example. NTA 

This is not a healthy relationship, at all. The man can’t use a microwave because it’s a “chore” NTA I hate being like leave him but this is abuse, you NEED to leave. It is not your job to cater to him. He’s a grown adult and you’re already taking care of an infant and a toddler. Him yelling at you like a dog is not okay, him Potentially waking the kids forcing you to cook for him and then go back to taking care of them is not okay. Him keeping you sleep deprived is not okay. Again he is abusing you. Take yourself and your kids out of this situation. WHY are you married to this overgrown child? 

>He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger


I can't even count the ways of how ridiculous this is. Like I am beyond words. 

This man needs to move back to his mommy's house. 

NTA (although you'll be an AH to yourself if you don't get the fuck out of this marriage). Hey OP, i know youre married and have kids, but these are some MAJOR red flags. First off, **NTA** 

Please consider that this attitude towards you basically being a slave is not going to stop unless you say something to him about it, he is acting like a child and youre his mommy. NTA and putting food in the microwave is not a chore, it is literally SO easy. You do not need to cater to his every whim just because he's got a job. He's a grown man. NTA. If he can drive his tired ass home, he can walk his tired ass into the kitchen to heat his meal It’s posts like these that make never want to have a stay-at-home wife/mom. It must suck knowing how draining and stressful it can be to support a family, only to come home to be berated by my wife because she doesn’t want to make a meal. I know this is not OP’s situation exactly, but judging by some of the comments, she shouldn’t be expected to make any meals for him period and that he should start doing more chores. And I’m not suggesting being a SAHM is easy, but the amount of self back-patting they do is a bit ridiculous. I think 95% of people would rather be home tending to their baby than giving CPR to a dying old lady, or giving a presentation to executives, or a writing a 100 page legal document. There is always a strong lack of perspective. With all due respect to you, you are raising three babies. Your grown husband just decided to send himself to bed hungry instead of reheating his own dinner because he considers every task that needs to be done inside the home your job and your job only, even when it only benefits him. I am angryfor you and I do not think you should back down on this. A stay at home mom is not her husband's servant. He seems to have gotten that twisted. NTA. Father here. OP you are NTA, He is X1000. Raising kids is one of the most physically and emotionally draining things I’ve ever done. It’s not physically demanding like manual labor but sleep deprivation is a legitimate form of torture and prevents your body from recovering. For him to wake you (and possibly the kids)  by yelling for you from the other room he is denying you the sleep YOU NEED so you can reheat a meal you already prepared. I can’t even imagine the entitlement. Nta, I've worked random hours most of my adult life. Never have I expected my wife to cater to my hunger 24/7. If I get home from work at a random time and I'm hungry I make myself food. Even when one of us hasn't worked we always shared chores. This is extremely childish and disrespectful behavior towards you. You are being treated like property or a servant. Time to ask yourself hard questions. NTA. If reheating a meal prep is a chore for him I’m not sure he should be an EMT. NTA. You were also working non stop. The work he doesn’t isn’t more important than the work you do. He needs to contribute to the household and stop behaving like a child. Holy. Shit.

What an abusive trash of a human. He is capable of reheating food.
Fuck, he's lucky you even went through the effort of cooking for him in the first place.

Red flag- he is emotionally abusing you.

NTA. NTA

Not even a little bit. Im sending a hug to you right now.

There are many people (myself included) who work full time, then come home and cook themselves food. To have it ready to heat up is an awesome feeling. I batch cook alot myself, i put 90% in the freezer 10% in the fridge that way it doesnt go off. Takes a couple more mins to reheat from frozen but you can just take it out earlier. I also use a chalk marker to write on the pots so i know whats in them.

The fact he woke you up, to shove a plate in the microwave, then refused to eat because you wouldnt do it for him is disgusting behaviour. Its downright nasty and controlling. Saying you made him pass out from hunger is pathetic. He is a grown man. He is more than capable of putting the food in his mouth and chewing! Also the majority of people wouldnt pass out from having 1 meal later than usual. Also shouting while you have 2 sleeping children?!?

You have a toddler and a baby. You still spent days prepping food for him as well as looking after these two, yourself and the house. You are one strong lady. 

Honestly, i would sit and look at how he treats you. Before you try explain it away to yourself, its not because he's stressed or tired. He is choosing to be like this, why? I couldnt say at this point, but you probably have an inkling. 
Try talking to your mum, she probably see's more than you realise.
Put you and the kids first for a while. You deserve to be happy, to be treated kindly and not to be guilted and demeaned for petty things. This is controlling behaviour, you do not deserve this. Your NTA. 

Does he also expect you to wipe his ass? He’s a grown man, he can do a simple reheating. If he was living by himself he would have no choice but to do it. 

You’re with someone who doesn’t respect you OP. He just sees you as a mere servant. NTA.... I agree with what everyone else said here, and I won't be redundant.

I would have thrown every premade dinner into the garbage and told him to fend for himself from now on. NTA

I was stupid when I was younger. Pulled a similar stunt with my wife. She tossed me out on my ear and took my stuff to my mom's house. Said ""Obviously you aren't an adult and Mommy needs to redo everything."" Then proceeded to change the locks, her phone number and ignore me for about 6 weeks. After my mom stopped laughing hysterically, about 3 weeks, she asked me if I was done being an idiot. Then told me if I wanted to save my marriage, I'd better go to the marriage counseling thing and put my mouth in park, my ears in drive. We got through it, but I never did anything like that again. My wife has zero tolerance for anything she calls misogynistic,

I think you'd be better off without him. Nta. I don't think tis is about food. As heating up your own dinner is not exactly a chore Do you know what? When he goes to work next time, take the kids (and all important papers/passports and such) to your moms place, with all the essentials for a week, and just stay there. Make him fend for himself for a week. Do NOT CLEAN before you leave; just take the kids and go. And when he calls, answer on speaker phone and tell him that he's on it. And when he cusses at you for leaving the house dirty or whatever,  just say: yeah, well you didn't think I did anything so, I just left it so you can do my ""nothings"" and I'll just stay here for a while. Make sure to record the string of abuse coming from this idiot and save it. And for your sake and your kids' sake, don't go back to this ass hat. NTA

>He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner

You could easily say the same thing. You're working as well. *It's ridiculous for him to assume that after working non-stop for an entire shift you should be expected to get out of bed just to heat up a pre-made dish.* 

Tons of red flags coming from the hubs, OP, that everyone else has hit upon. I think this is a troll post. I generally believe them but I know how much EMTs make and there is no way that you have two kids, are a SAHM and live off what he makes. He’d never be home because of all the overtime he’d have to collect to support a household. I’m not buying it. 
If you’re real, you’re NTA. But i doubt this is real. NTA, and i think you should take this as a HUGE red flag. Being a sahm is a job as well! You work all day with a 3 yr old AND a 6 month old, and that's not an easy thing to do. You make sure they're fed, well rested, you cook, you clean, you work so hard to make sure the house is stable while your husband goes to work. Before this incident, has he ever thanked you for all the hard work you do around the house? Or does he just demand food? Plus, it doesn't take that long to put something in the microwave and heat it up. The longest I've used the microwave, is 12 minutes to make macaroni. It takes so much less time than that just to reheat food that has already been cooked and refrigerated. He can't go another 3-5 minutes off his feet to reheat food, because he thinks his wife should do it cause she's not getting paid to do chores and take care of the kids?! He is such an AH.  


I'm also going to point out, he got up to YELL AT OP, but didn't go to reheat the food, and tried to emotionally manipulate her, by saying it's her fault he's going to bed hungry. This is manipulative, and abusive behavior.  


apologies for any errors, writing was never my strong suit Omg. NTA. Your husband is. I agree with other comments saying that his behavior is abusive. Are you sure you didn't marry a teenage boy? Jfc NTA NTA,

It's not a chore, it's reheating your own dinner. You're his wife, not his mom, but either way he shouldn't expect anybody to get up out of bed to reheat his food. 

&#x200B;

TBH in your shoes, I would probably replace the pre-made meals with a pack of bologna and loaf of bread, that way he won't have to worry about heating it. Divorce NTA. A man who cant feed himself is just a baby He can starve lmfao NTA, 
It's one thing he's expecting warm dinner in normal hours, but to wake you up is such an asshole thing to do.
Tell him to buy dinner next time, if he can't warm it up. Ooof, your husband is next level. You are NTA, I mean come on, he's so lazy he can't even reheat a meal that's already cooked in the microwave? I would be extremely, over the moon grateful to come home and the only thing I have to do is pop something in the microwave. Does this man do anything around the house at all, or parent in the slightest? You are not his servant, he needs to get his sh\*t together. Nta - He wants a maid not a wife , DO NOT LET HIM . I didn't even have to read the post to say that you are NTA. Wow. If i was married to a guy that acted like this, held come home to an empty house and divorce paper.  Nta. Leave his pathetic sexist misogynistic ass 

Its 2022, not 1922. You are NOT TA! You're being more than reasonable (overly, IMHO).
You are, however, being emotionally abused 🚩🚨
Marriage counseling or get out, before his irrational behavior escalates. I’d make him a nice lunch to take to work. Get it all packed for him and everything. Give him a kiss, apologize the whole 9 yards.

When he opens his lunch let him see just dirty diapers, a sandwich made with moldy bread, and an empty capri-sun.

Leave this man. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Leave. 

NTA So it's ridiculous to think a grown man should heat up (not even cook!) his own dinner but it's **_not_** ridiculous that a grown man arrives home and starts shouting from the living room at 11pm?!

This is seriously messex up and you need to seriously rethink this relationship. I highly doubt this is an isolated case. This has all the signs of someone who doesn't respect you one bit. NTA. NTA. As someone who is so married to a first responder, I recommend you (preferably both of you) find a therapist who specializes in first responder families. 

Yes his job is unpredictable and challenging, but he has no right to treat you this way. NTA.  You have a full time job with no time off.  Is he expecting to be spoonfed too? Info: how is using a microwave a chore?

NTA but if you don’t put your foot down now, you can expect these absurd behavior to continue forever. The silent treatment is a form of abuse so the best way to handle is by enjoying the break from his nonsense until he decides to stop throwing his childish tantrum My spouse works third shift/first shift and he heats up his own food at 5AM or whatever time he gets home that day. Shocker: we don’t have kids and I work part time and he still cooks and does dishes a couple times a week. Your husband is acting like a spoiled child and you should NEVER give in to a temper tantrum from a child or an adult! I hope you guys can work it out or you move on without him in your life. It’s not my life so I’m not going to tell you what you need to do but I do hope you read some of these or most of these comments and make an educated decision for yourself and your children. Stay safe! NTA and this is a massive red flad

this isn't about food, this is about control.

is this the first time \[think about it\] he's behaved like this? NTA.  I’d like to see OP address the comments regarding abuse. However, I doubt they will because someone who has been abused for a long time will be in denial about it.  Self esteem and confidence battered over the years. It’s sad. What…the fuck?

As someone already stated, this isn’t about food. It’s about control. He got pissed because you said no. Just because you are a sahm does NOT mean you do absolutely EVERYTHING. And to WAKE UP to throw some damn food in the microwave when he has two perfectly good hands? Hell no. Absolutely not. 

The fact that he thinks making his own food is a chore is very telling. 

Obviously NTA, please start considering leaving. You deserve better than this. You are absolutely NTA-this is abusive, manipulative, narcissistic behavior please try to find a way out of this relationship before it ends badly. NTA. I'm guessing when your husband was little he used to hold his breath to spite his mother. Reheating something is not a big deal. The controlling hissy fit your husband threw is though. NTA. Being a stay at home mom doesn't mean you're his house elf. This doesn't sound like a respectful relationship to me. this is very similar behavior to my aunt’s abusive husband My ex-huband (notice the EX) and I had different days off.  I would be just walking in the door after my hour long drive in heavy traffic.  I would barely be in the door and he would say ""whats for dinner"" while he was laying on the couch watching tv.  I started to really hate him. NTA, you worked non stop for an entire shift at home as well. You took care of your kids and the house. The least he can do is not add to your worries. He’s not a baby! He needs to realize that the only reason he can do an entire shift is because you’re a sahm. So he should be grateful for you. NTA. This was horrible to read. Your partner is showing no respect for you and what you do and how tired you are. His behaviour sounds controlling and disturbing. As others have said red flags all over the place. You deserve better than being treated like that. HOLY ABUSE.!

What in the world.

NTA NTA.  Don't let him run over you.  Tell him to warm his own effing food or go hungry.  If he starts yelling at you, then tell him that he is getting ready to have way bigger problems than hungriness.  Quit playing his game. NTA. Is he a child or something? You should divorce him. “ I do it because of how hard he works “.  I would love to see how he feels after spending a day doing what you do.  3 years and 6 months are ages where there is constant work with little downtime.  He is a major AH to wake you up to reheat his food. NTA, you are NOT his servant.  You are his wife. NTA—but I’m worried for you. You are neither required to make his meals, neither is he relinquished from taking care of himself since he brings in the money. In curious to hear what he does on the weekends. This sounds like a man that pays no attention to his own kids because he has you. You are neither a slave nor his nanny, and him commanding you and then guilt tripping you over food makes me feel like he probably manipulates you on all matters. Listen to the comments here. This is abuse. And if he’s unwilling to work on it through therapy, I would start looking into steps of leaving him for yourself and your children. This kind of demand for control and lack of empathy will transfer to them too. Please take this comment section serious and seek emotional help with a family member or friend that doesn’t idolize your husband. NTA You have 3 kids, not 2, and clearly the one you're married to is way spoiled! NTA

OMG.

🚩 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 NTA but YTA for staying with this asshole. NTA - this reminds me so much of my ex husband, when I got home from work at 11 pm and he was there with a terrible headache since who knows when, but hadn’t taken anything. Just waiting for me. So I had to go get him a glass of water, get the Advil bottle, open, put two pills in his hand… because somehow he couldn’t have done that himself.
I hope the two of you can have a serious conversation when you are both calm and not tired, and that he can appreciate what you do. If he doesn’t accommodate for when you need to sleep, it wouldn’t be a healthy marriage at all or role models your children should be exposed to as they grow. Ewww your husband is a jerk! YOU worked all day too! Taking care of a 3yr and 6 month old is a 24/7 job 

Your NTA! Let him reheat his own damn food NTA

This is abuse, plain and simple. He is taking advantage of you, he is controlling you, he is terrorizing you.

Normally I would say you should get out of that situation immediately without a second thought, but you said his profession is a paramedic.

My question to you is, is this normal behaviour for him? Think hard and think long about his behaviour from meeting him, to your relationship, to your marriage, up to now. And compare it to when he became a paramedic.

PTSD can cause all sorts of major problems, and I know a number of First Responders go from being amazing people to extremely troubled, due to the whores they see every single day.

That is not to say that I'm defending your husband's actions. Far from it. Regardless of the situation, you need to get help involved. Rather, if there's an actual reason behind this behaviour, and if it's a recent shift in his personality, you might be able to get him help, and you might be able to get your husband back.

But if he's always been like this, or if he refuses to get help... get out of that situation as soon as you can. You deserve better. It doesn't matter that he's the breadwinner and you're a stay-at-home mom. That doesn't excuse abuse. These types of posts are so unbelievably upsetting. Don’t put up with an abusive man like this. NTA, but your husband is.

Honestly, why do women stay with these men?  He can't reheat a plate of food?  Are you joking?  Why are you procreating with this asshole? Wow. Just wow. OP. My husband is (sorta) a first responder. (He is higher up and makes way more then whatever peanuts an ambulance driver brings home.)Works crazy hours. Gets dragged out of the house on calls. Is gone for days or weeks at a time and would never ever expect this of me. Never. First. I would laugh in his face if he had the audacity. Then he would be a sad lonely man with half his salary and pension gone. Take his little 40k a year and let him make ramen every single night. He is doing this to control you. How else does he control you? Where you go. Money you spend. Must be tough on one salary with two little kids. Will he “allow” you to have a job? NTA…. 
 but you are if you stay and let your children see someone treat you this way. 
****I do make meals for my family. I get up and make him breakfast and dinner is usually ready. But our standing routine is I have dinner ready around 7. If he’s not home to eat with us then it will be on the stove or in the fridge. But I do it because I want to. Because he is my partner and he works long hours doing an at times dangerous job and still does things like home repairs, cleans up on a day off, does his laundry, takes me on surprise trips, is involved with the kids and respects me above all else. And I do the same. This man does not respect you. He does not care for your well-being. He would wake you up to have you push buttons on a microwave. He thinks he is something he is not. Let that dead weight go. i work 15 hours a day, and i will never expect anyone,  specially not my sleeping wife, to reheat food for me. 

he is an controlling abusing partner and you need to seek support and leave. this is gonna get ugly fast.

take care OP, as many, many people have pointed out already, you find yourself in an abusive relationship. Having a SAHM is not equivalent to having a maid/slave who will drop everything and cater to your needs once you get home. A friend of mine is the breadwinner and has a very, very busy/important job (he works in the office from 6:30 am to often 5:00-5:30 pm, goes home and then works some more on his laptop or reviewing documents). His wife is a SAHM and they have two older kids (8-10) who go to school. Guess what, he still pulls his weight in the house (does all the landscaping in their 2 acres property), grocery shopping, cooking some times, cleaning around the house, every little projects she wants done in the house (he just finished tiling a whole powder room, took him 3 days during his personal time). There are expectations for SAHM because it's also a job (it's not free labour, you don't get paid but you do most of the chores, maintaining the house, taking care of the kids while young, you even cook every meal for crying out loud). The least, and I mean the absolute lowest of the least he could do is to put a plate in the microwave and wait 2 min for his food to be warm (food that you prepared in advance and plated so he could have food as soon as he's home no matter when that is). This man is privileged to the tits......and he still complains about his situation? Next thing he'll expect you to chew his food and baby bird feed him! I don't know where you're from (maybe a country where this behaviour is still socially acceptable) but where I'm from (Canada) this man would be shamed by everyone he knows for the kind of abusive BS he's putting his wife through. Do yourself a favour, pack the kids, take your important belongs and go somewhere else (family if you have good ones). And consult a divorce lawyer who will help you get what you are owed so you can start a life that you actually deserve (you already do everything in the house, might as well do it just for you and your kids and cut out the dead weight) I'm a paramedic and my wife is at home with our 4 month old. . . Your husband is a complete arsehole.
I work 12's days and nights. I prep my own meals, i cook for my wife when I am home because she is taking care of the most important thing. . . Our Child! 
WTF is wrong with this guy. You have 3 kids to take care of because your husband is not an adult.

NTA obviously. NTA. Please explain to me how he “almost passed out from hunger” while at the same time tell you that “he’s going to bed hungry “. Is he that freaking stupid? Also if I was you I would have told him calmly, that all the while he is arguing with you he could have microwaved his dinner and have started to eat.  

In the future, don’t engage, don’t argue, just state the fact and go on your way. Remind him that if you weren’t there he would have to fend for himself so if he doesn’t like to reheat well, there is a much more expensive solution. NTA I get after his job he would be tired but he should be able to just quickly put his Dinner in the microwave for at most a couple minutes Change the locks. You couldn't reach him to tell him about it because his phone was off. Meanwhile, call a lawyer. Let the man starve if he is this petty and doesn't have any respect for you. He is a grown man he can heat up his own food. And if not he can starve Nta your husband sounds like a prick, does he expect you to wipe his own ass too? YOU’RE petty to prove a point?? Oh, honey. NTA NTA. at all. this is abusive. threaten to leave him if his behaviours don’t improve. you don’t deserve any of this. nta. the answer here is very simple. next time he has a day off.. leave him with the kids, all day... do a ladies day with your mum and mother in law so he has no one to turn to. Lets see his attitude after that.  Girl. He is mad you stopped behaving like his slave. This is NOT OK. THIS IS NOT OK. 

DO NOT ACCEPT HIS APOLOGY WHEN IT COMES! ACCEPT ONLY THERAPY.

Nta NTA. I feel sorry for any patients that have to deal with him as well. NTA. Who raised this man? This is the behavior of a very spoiled child. Insist on marriage counseling. I would like to point out that you referring to your husband an “ambulance driver” makes me think there are deeper issues because, at least in my region, there is no such profession and he’s either a paramedic or an EMT. I find your choice of wording curious. YOU’RE petty to prove a point? Oh, honey. NTA. So it's your fault a grown up man doesn't know how to reheat something? And because he is hungry? If he doesn't know how to, there are million tutorials on YouTube for everything, including reheating dinner. If he doesn't want to he can always eat it cold. Nta NTA NTA NTA,

as a past victim of emotional abuse and manipulation, reading this made my stomach lurch into my throat. he's trying to maintain control over you by acting like this and is reflecting that of a child, not a grown ass man w a job and children. please seek outside counsel if you intend on maintaining this relationship w him as someone like this will not reason w you and will only become more hostile if you attempt to call him out and settle it yourself NTA. Your husband is an asshole who clearly doesn't appreciate you. NTA- in the time it took to wake you up,he could have reheated the food. He only went to bed hungry because he didn't get you to kowtow to him. Don't even bother to get out of bed . You are not his servant. Omg. What did I just read? Please tell me this is AITA fiction writing to get a rise out of people. I just can’t OP. NTA obviously. Your husband needs to get into a time machine back to 1912. Wish him luck and move on. NTA.

Your husband isn’t being reasonable. You work hard also, probably longer hours, too. Him waking you up to feed him is hurting both of you. Absolutely not. Microwaving takes 2-3 minutes . In the time he wasted  arguing with you, he could’ve heated his dinner and finished eating it. Yes, I’ve known some single paramedics. They ended up starving to death in filthy homes because they didn’t have anyone to cook and clean for them. These grown adults who deal with medical emergencies simply cannot push a button on a microwave. It’s an epidemic…

Seriously OP, I hope the comments here give you some insight into just how wrong all this is. Waking a spouse to heat up the meal they’ve cooked for you would be abusive even if you weren’t also caring for two tiny children round the clock. Your husband sounds VERY much like a gaslighter. Blaming you, ridiculing you, and then acting like the victim, etc. Ask yourself if you want to be treated like this for the rest of your life. By extension, ask yourself if you want your kids to be treated like this—usually this kind of manipulative behavior does NOT stop at the spouse. He will most likely treat the kids like this, as well. At the very least, they will be subjected to seeing him verbally abuse and manipulate you. Either way, this is *not* a good place to be in.

I recommend you leave him and fight for custody of your kids. You may think to yourself, “Having both parents is better than just one!” and I’m here to tell you that no, in this situation it is not. One parent is better than two parents where one is manipulative and immature. 

Best wished and luck, OP. 🍀 NTA. Wow !!!! The audacity is shocking This is cringe he is a baby and this is abusive behavior. As an adult you cannot throw fits to get your way. You’re not his mom. I could microwave my own food since I was 5 years old. He wants to be served and have everything handed to him. This is an abusive narcissist you are married to. Take the children and run. OP, I just want to say that his job is NOT more important than the job you are doing okay, taking care of your kids.

His behaviour is so awful and sounds so manipulative and abusive. You're NTA, I hope that you will start by reconnecting with your past social support system (friends, family, etc) and let people know what's going on. If it comes to the point where you need to escape quickly, please work on having a safe spot with trusted people to go to. Your husband is the asshole I’d say just keep doing what you’re doing, and if he doesn’t heat his own food that’s his problem. NTA NTA. He’s super controlling and manipulative. Get out asap because he shouldn’t be treating you like that. He is a full grown man, capable of making his own meals. It is a privilege that he even gets a home cooked meal from his wife already prepared and ready to go when he gets home. NTA. Time for hubby to join the rest of us in the 21st century. You are not his employee. You are not his slave. He either learns to use a microwave oven or he gets served divorce papers. He needs to be a man not a toddler. “He works so hard”

Ambulance drivers have long periods of sitting around doing nothing interrupted by short periods of work. He is not too exhausted to reheat his dinner. He’s an asshole. NTA He must think he’s Nicholas Cage and the movie Bringing out the dead is about him. NTA I think he's trying to prove a point, he wants you to do more. OR maybe he thinks a woman's place is to provide the meals. Reheating food is not the least bit of a chore. So there's no reason he can't do it, he just doesn't want to do it. NTA

He is grown  
Your not the MOMMA.

Sounds like he has NO, clue what a stay @ home parent does .

Now for reference.   I am aa 56 w/m.  My wife has been a stay @ home parent for 21 to our 5 children.   I am so thankful. It is because of her I have been able to get as far in my field. 
I am. Blessed. NTA. You work too and need your sleep. If he hasn't learned consideration, he needs to be taught some. Only had to read up to the first para to know you're NTA here. NTA. If simply putting something in the microwave is a chore, how much does he parent the kids? Or I suppose he might call it babysitting. Jesus. Run far away from this sorry excuse for a human being Nta. Heating  up food takes two minutes tops and the microwave does all the work D I V O R C E NTA in the slightest. 

My brother is a paramedic with odd hours. If I found he acted anything close to this to a partner I would personally take him TF out. This is abuse. He is a grown man. No matter the job he is still an equal partner who is not showing you proper love and respect. You are a WIFE and NOT his servant. Also most medics have the ability to make meals at the station, why can he not take a meal and be self-sufficient like I’m sure every other person at the station?! And they usually have some down time to rest etc - which you are not getting during the day with two children. This behavior is completely inexcusable. This guy is pathetic. He is so lazy he won’t stick his own dinner on the microwave. Also does he think you sit on your butt all day with 2 kids in the house.

I would be having serious words about his attitude towards you and why he is apparently incapable of hearing up his own dinner. NTA. What everyone else said and more. I’m a SAHM myself and my husband works 14 hour days 5-6 days a week so I get it. The difference is my husband will STILL pick up groceries on his way home, cook dinner sometimes simply because he likes to, do the dishes, help clean, help take care of baby etc when he can. And the way HE described it to ME was, at least he gets to clock out. At least he gets lunch breaks. At least he can take a shit without a baby crying on the other side of the bathroom door. At least he gets “days off”. Work as a SAHP never stops. Even while I sleep I have a baby monitor right next to me should I need to wake in the night to care for baby. 

Your husband is no partner to you. You guys either need some serious couples counseling or you need to drop him, and something tells me he won’t go to therapy Hey you want to know what my husband has NEVER done? Yell at me at 11pm to make him or reheat his dinner. It’s literally 2 minutes on high in microwave. You are absolutely correct. What’s far far more concerning is his reaction. His view on your contributions. I would totally hand him the kids and tell him, if you are so not useful, he can obviously do your job better. Leave them with him. Go home at 11 and demand HE reheat your food. The point? So he can see how absolutely gross he is being. This guy would need an ambulance if he tried this at my house.  NTA It's moderately ridiculous that he can't reheat a plate, ESPECIALLY when he's hungry! Bullshit like this is a choice. There's no good reason to be this abusive. You don’t have a husband, you have a third child.

NTA Yooo u p3do! You married a baby!!? NTA. You need to sit your husband down and ask him what your days off are and what hours you are supposed to work during a day??? Because expecting you to be on duty for 24/7 is just not sustainable. If he cannot even reheat a meal when you are asleep, he needs to explain exactly what your hours are, so you know when you are off duty. Even mothers and wives cannot be expected to be on call 24/7 for weeks, much less months or years at a time. Your working hours are simply going to put you in the hospital or an early grave if this keeps up. Is he trying to kill you with stress so that he can raise the kids and do all the housework himself? >I'm a sahm with 2 kids (3yrs old & 6months old)

NTA. You actually have 3 kids (3yrs old & 6months old and a grown ass man). NTA

Divorce him. It’s not going to get better. 

🚩🚩🚩🚩 NTA 

Hes controlling af. Gtf out of there for you and your kids sake NTA, taking care of kids is also work. Unpaid by the way! So he better stop sulking and acting like a child, you already have 2, you sure you need 3? Take your kids and leave. Then he can work, pay child support and alimony and you'll have peace and quiet. He can cook and heat up all his meals, alone. Like he deserves. INFO: What's it like being married to someone who has ZERO respect for you? NTA. 

Tell him to get fucked, and leave. I'm a nurse and I'd be willing to bet the ED hates him. oh my good divorce him nta NTA - Okay, he brings money to house, but this doesn't means he is a king at home. If he were living alone, he would simply starve and die? 

He's controlling and abusive. NTA. At all.

That being said: ""ambulance driver"" is considered to be a highly offensive and diminutive term for EMS professionals. I don't know if he's feeling disrespected, but it's not an excuse for behaving in such a manner. NTA. What the hell did I just read? TIL putting food in the microwave is a chore.

^obligatory ^/s


NTA Pack you and the kids and run to your moms because honey as everyone is saying this is abuse Aside from the fact that this man is abusive and unhinged, I'm honestly worried about him being in a caregiving profession. How does he treat people in the ambulance? Some people are only in jobs like that (*cough* cops) so they have someone to bully. NTA, ots absolutely no excuse but he may have been having a rough day with no outlet and took it out on you. Again, its definitely no excuse but gives you an idea why he was being an asshole. I(29M, Army) work super wierd hours and it took me some serious self reflection and therapy AND communication for me to leave my work bullshir at the door. 

Its fucking rough with a newborn and odd schedule but food is absolutely his responsibility. If there's prepped meals at home, sick. If not, its noones job but his to figure out how to get fed and come home to rest and relax, not yours. You are not his mother. 

Talk with him and set clear expectations because as draining as his job is, you're definitely working full and overtime with zero praise or pats on the back. Caring for toddlers and infants is rough on their own but together sounds like an absolute nightmare. Hes a grown ass adult and can handle himself. Girl - how did you manage to get pregnant by this fool TWICE?! He spent more energy berating you than if he had lifted his index finger to push a button on the microwave. You made his meal. He was born with the tools, AKA fingers. Waking you up to do what he could’ve easily done is abusive. NTA! NTA. Divorce and move on lol, dude has serious issues. TF lol, taking you up at like 11pm to REHEAT a meal for him? GEes louise. You need to leave this relationship. Nta. NTA and you are married to an abuser. Make a plan, talk to some professionals, and get yourself and kids to a safer living situation. >He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty

He's refusing to use a microwave and blaming you for his hunger but *you're* being petty? Lol. NTA.

He's a jerk. Too bad you’ve already procreated with this misogynistic asshole.

NTA, OP! Yikes. I’m so very sorry for your miserable situation. You deserve better. Far better. Oh honey, my heart breaks for you. I can’t even render a judgment, all I can tell you is that you need to get out, NOW. Go to your parents, go to your best friend, someone you trust and take the kids. Because this is not gonna get better.

You have a misogynist partner that doesn’t respect you. A SAHM is not supposed to be on 24/7. If he goes to work for 12 hour shifts, so do you. His shift is your shift because you are taking care of the home. When he gets home it’s supposed to be 50/50 because that’s fair. Because you both did “work”. Him coming home and expecting to be waited on shows that he thinks he “provides” and that you don’t. 

It’s flabbergasting. Does he know how much a NANNY for a toddler and an infant costs??? And a house cleaner, and a cook? Because that is basically the service you are providing. You are providing 1 on 1 specialized care to 2 kids plus cooking and cleaning. In my area all those responsibilities combined is easily 60-70k a year. If you went back to a career and put both kids in daycare, that’s still easily 25-35k a year. Your “salary” if you did this for some other family is probably more than what your husband makes!

My dear, if my husband did this to me. I would be running as if my tampon string is on fire and he would be served divorce papers in the morning. So please, be kind to yourself AND your children who do not need to see the bastard of a husband you have and internalize his actions as ok. Please leave. Communicate only through couples counseling, but no debating on your own is gonna make this better.

Do right by your children and most importantly, do right by you. You are IMPORTANT. You’re his wife, not his slave. Cannot believe what I’ve just read. NTA obviously. NTA. NTA. NTA!!! This is one of the easiest NTAs I've seen I'm my 7 freaking years on reddit! This is a grown adult working man we are talking about. So, yes, he *should* be ""expected"" to do a ""chore"" that is really just taking care of himself. Would he just let himself and the kids starve to death if something happened that made you unable to take care of everyone?? Did his mommy feed him and cook his every meal whenever he wanted up until the day he married you? Hasn't he ever taken care of himself? 

He literally *woke you up by yelling from another room* so that you could *warm up* some food that *you already cooked for him*, and then he claims he's about to pass out because ""you won't feed him"" and he *dares* to call you ""petty""?!

NEWS FLASH: HE IS THE PETTY ONE!!!

Dude, I am so sorry that you even think you could possibly be the asshole here. You were not awake when he got home. You'd been taking care of two young children all day. Then he comes home from work, while everyone else is asleep, and decides that he's too lazy to warm up some pre-made food on his own so instead he'll just yell at you until you get up to do it for him. 
I don't care what his job is or what cooking appliances you have, he's an adult and can heat up his own damn dinner. There is literally no excuse for this unless he has some sort of health condition that should have been at least vaguely mentioned, and even then, there would only be an excuse for the needs/demands but absolutely not this kind of behavior. I am so angry for you, he should have stopped acting like this in his early teens. 


It sounds like you are putting a ton of effort into taking care of your family, but please, OP, don't forget to take care of yourself too. Please don't neglect your mental health, it might be helpful to chat with a therapist once in a while, especially if you don't have a solid support system around you. And make sure you get some time to your self on a somewhat regular basis, everyone needs and deserves to relax whether they have a paying job or not (you've still got full-time responsibilities). Anyway,  I'm getting  a  bit off topic here but when you do get some downtime, think about what you want for the future and if you can truly see it happening happily with this man. And I beg of you, for your children, and as a child of divorce myself, if you are unhappy, please please do not stay in this relationship for the kids. No matter how well you hide your conflict,  resentment, or whathaveyou, the toxicity and dysfunctional behaviors are subconsciously learned and accepted and this carries on into their adult relationships and the pattern repeats itself. 


I didn't intend to get so dark, but much of this post felt all too familiar to me and it just seemed to be dripping in red. I hope that things work out for the best, whatever that may be. And don't hesitate to reach out for help from others when you need it, if not for yourself then do it for your children. Best wishes,  be well. Fuck no NTA. He's using his schedule as an excuse to be pampered. I'm a cop. I work 12 hour shifts. When I come home from the night shift I don't wake up my wife to make me food. When I work the day shift and come home in the afternoon I don’t expect her to make me anything. I even hang out with my daughter while my wife eats. He's an AH. Not you. Op this is a huge red flag, FR IDK WHAT TO SAY BUT HE IS GONNA BE DEMANDING UNLESS YOU PUT A STOP TO THIS, I’m sorry Tell him your gonna rat him out that he is"" too weak and stupid to reheat a ready made meal"" to his crew, ""they may need to feed him before he comes home because he violently wakes you because he's sooo hungry.""

nta Heat up and serve him a divorce. Eww, sorry, but this sounds like nonsense from my grandfather’s time.

I am pregnant and have a toddler.  My husband made curry today.  He knows how hard it is to take care of small children all day.  I only work two days a week now (all the childcare I can get) and I look forward to that ‘break.’

NTA

You husband sounds like a helpless child. NTA but holy hell I would have stopped putting up with this a long time ago. In all that time he bitched about being hungry, he could have heated up his food and eaten. I'd be going on strike. Let him pout all he wants.

I'm so furious for you right now. Like ride at dawn with a baseball bat level furious. NTA feeding himself is not a ""chore"" it's something that we all have to do to survive. He's lucky that he has a cooked meal waiting for him and all he has to do is reheat it. This makes me horribly sad and upset
You’re NTA ~Inserts gif of Adele saying ‘ divorce babe, divorce’ 

This man is trying to control you and you need to run. He doesn’t respect you nor your children Stick to your guns and don't reheat for him.. You're his wife not his mom Eta NTA

Oh man. Im so sorry your dealing with this. He may be exhausted, but so are you. You have 2 kids not 3. He can reheat his own food. His emotional manipulation is a red flag for me.. also the fact that he would shout an possibly wake up you or the kids is super disrespectful.. like who does that?! NTA. House work is work. You are working as hard as him. Leave him. He has arms and legs if he wants his food, it's up to him. I won't let anyone treat me like a maid and neither should you. He cries and whines, he can sleep his lazy a$$ on the couch. Honey, you are NTA for this.

But you will be if you stay and nothing changes. 

I hope if the kids woke up, they let you know they were awake and scared. Because if they woke up, and didn't tell you, that means they have already learned to take cover when there is yelling. This means they already learned how to protect themselves ~from their father~. 

I wonder if your 3 y/o woke up, and hid in their covers? If they share a room, did they comfort each other?

This needs to change - either your husband gets counseling for the incredible burden that's causing him to act in a way that's not like him (EMTS are burned out but it is NO excuse), or you get the hell out. No counseling together. NTA, I continue to be astounded by these horrible men women partner with. I know it’s bad out there, but is it that bad? NTA - basically you’re raising 3 children not 2, there’s no reason he can’t heat up his own food . if he went to bed hungry it’s because HE chose to throw a tantrum. NTA but I bet you $20 he’s cheating. Omg. NTA. What a self centered control freak Hi! 

My partner is at the literal stress point of completing his dissertation WHILE teaching a class AND preparing a new class for summer AND 2 new classes for the job he just got that will begin in the fall. He is also leading and hosting lots of school activities. 

Also he is 100% blind. 

So he's tired, stressed, breakneck busy, AND the things he can cook for himself are limited. 

I also cook freezer meals for him so he has healthy variety. 

HE WOULD NEVER ON HIS WORST DAY ACT THIS WAY. 

I don't know if this is a ditch him level offense but it is a hard fuck that. He needs to grow up. You have 2 kids. Not 3. If you leave he will have to do a lot more than reheat premade dinners, so change is 100% in his future no matter what. This is the wrong sub. This should’ve been put on r/relationships or r/relationship_advice. It seems evident that OP is aware that she is NTA. Is he a child? No? Then NTA. He's using you as a nanny/mother. NTA. For goodness sakes, both your jobs are exhausting and you're not a maid. His hands aren't broken, he knows how to work a microwave. I'm hoping this is a case of him just being cranky because he was hungry, but what type of person shouts for someone in the living at 11pm when the rest of the house is asleep (especially children). You already did your part of the ""job"". As a SAHM, I totally think its reasonable he expects you to do at least most of the cooking (I think he should cook sometimes), but to work weird hours and expect to be catered to more than he has been already is just too much. Before my father had night shift (he now works an easier job on days because hes close to retirement), he worked swing shifts. My mother was a SAHM and had two children, he fully expected to have to reheat his own dinner and sometimes pack his own lunch (my mom usually put extra leftovers in a tupperware, but if he wanted something different, that was on him) because he knew he couldn't expect the other 3 people in the house to change their schedule specifically for him. I truly hope your husband adjusts because that sounds like a good system for you both considering how your schedules can conflict. Your anger is mysteriously late to the party.  Your husband is enough of an asshole to WAKE UP a sleeping woman who has a baby instead of feeding himself???  Was he not there getting zero sleep for the other kids????

NTA.  Feeding oneself is part of staying alive.  If he wants to starve instead of using a microwave, air fryer, or oven, that's his adult prerogative.  This is a hill to die on.  No job entitles a person to a personal slave 24/7. Woman. Just…. Why!? You need to take those kids and leave. NTA.  Your husband's behavior is unacceptable.  You have different schedules.  He should not be interrupting your sleep for anything less than an absolute emergency. I'd reconsider this marriage. NTA, he sounds like a child. It takes 5 mins to heat up in microwave Does he need his ass wiped after using the bathroom too?

OP, you are NTA! You’re carrying a household on your shoulders. If I came home and all I had to do was literally reheat a meal for under 5 mins in the microwave, that would make me so happy. 

He’s giving off major red flags that he won’t even reheat something. He expects you to do everything for him. What would he do if you took the kids and left for a few days? He’s a control freak. 

Pass out from hunger? Please. He needs to grow up. You have 3 babies If you divorce him he will die from hunger immediately as he is clearly incapable of feeding himself. 

Do the world a favor. 

Also NTA. Your husband is. OMG NTA

This is childish behavior for him. Not only does he expects you to have dinner ready every time he gets home, which is impossible and he should know, but also he refuses to do an extremely simple task by not wanting to heat his food. Yes! I believe you when you say he works hard and I understand why he wouldn't have the energy to make his meal when he came back. But he is so unreasonable whit you and he acts like a child: something a parent should not do when he/she has children. He even acts like a drama queen with this ""you let me starved"" bullshit.

That's a huge red flag! You need to get him into marriage counseling and make him understand why he is such a douche. If that doesn't work, try to see if you can find a job and try to work for a while without telling him and try to get enough money to get a lawyer and divorce him. Be sure you have enough funds so you can win the custody of your children.

DO WHAT IS BETTER FOR YOUR KIDS!!!! After that behavior, I’d eat every premade meal, and let him deal with feeding his own damn self. You *work*, probably harder than he does most days. I’m an ICU nurse turned SAHM, and usually, going toe to toe with the grim reaper was easier. NTA

If he thinks you not reheating his dinner for him is being petty, let him go hungry. Hell, go one step further and don't even bother cooking for him anymore if he doesn't want to even do that much for himself and sees it as your fault. I'm legit surprised he doesn't have you hand feed him. (Nevermind that it sounds like an absolute nightmare to deal with him in general.) Why do you even need to question if you are the AH here? You have gone above and beyond having a home-made meal ready to go in the fridge to heat up at a moment's notice for him. 

INFO: If he were single WHAT ON EARTH WOULD HE BE DOING???

You are not his slave, and you are NTA, either. You have EVERY RIGHT to be mad at how childish he is acting. I mean, even less mature than a child! My 7 year old would figure out how to heat up food in the microwave if I would let her. FFS. NTA and this whole community is worried about you.
Please get out of this marriage and be safe. This is not a person who respects you. The way he speaks to you is not normal, and this is not a mundane, everyday relationship disagreement involving expectations. This person deliberately antagonized you over drawing a perfectly reasonable boundary. NTA. NTA. You work all day, when is your break? Your husband is a major AH whose main goal is to control you. Like other people have commented, this is abuse. Many people work hard, long hours (doctors, nurses, EMTSs etc.), but your husband is using that as a blank cheque to act like a bratty king. 
When he yells at you when you are trying to rest, that shows absolutely NO CONSIDERATION for you or your babies. He is acting like a toddler with a temper tantrum. 
I think you may want to take a look at the way your husband is conditioning you to unnecessarily sacrifice yourself to disproportionately cater to his needs. He’s likely conditioned you into a master-slave relationship. It sounds like you’re a nice person but I’m betting you it’s one sided. 
“Why does he do that” by Lundy Bancroft sums up this perfectly. NTA NTA but please do something about that abusive AH you married. This is abuse. Maybe not physical abuse (tho who knows when the flip can switch), but it’s abuse. Emotional, and financial abuse. You’re a SAHM, which means he controls the money you have access to. This would be ok in a non-abusive relationship, but right now it is dangerous. Start planning your escape. Seek out support and help, this is NOT ok. Um NTA and also red 🚩 🚩 🚩  city?

I understand ambulance drivers work long hours and it can be emotionally taxing, I do. That being said, being a sahm is ALSO long hours and emotionally taxing.

In fact, based on his incredibly childish reaction to spending 2 minutes heating up a fucking dinner, I'm going to wager you do most of the childcare, even when he IS home. 

That aside, this grown ass man decided to go to bed hungry despite the fact that there were meals prepped and ready to go, they just needed to be heated up. And then blame you. That's ridiculous. 

Furthermore, instead of just heating it up his damn self, he YELLED from the downstairs while you were SLEEPING after a long, exhausting day taking care of your children. I was a sahm for a brief period of time when I was with my ex to his 2 kids (6yo at the time and a toddler) from a previous relationship as well as our own infant daughter. It's not easy. Especially when you have little to no help from your partner (I did not have a lot of help from their dad) for whatever reason.

NTA NTA NTA

And maybe re-examine the relationship, OP. At the VERY LEAST, he is inconsiderate of your time. NTA

Y'all need therapy.

He sounds like he doesn't respect the work that goes into being a SAHM, or the money it saves on not having to take kids to daycare. Controlling, abusive behavior, huge red flag NTA!

My husband is an ambulance driver too and you know what he expects when getting home late? Everyone to be in bed asleep!

If he gets home for in time for our evening meal he joins us, if not he’s perfectly willing and capable of reheating his food.  

Your husband needs to realise that you’re his partner, not his slave. NTA. 

Let me fix that for you.  ""I'm a SAHM with 3 kids. (3yrs old, 6 months old, and 30 something years old) For your health and for your kid’s mental health and their futures, leave him. NTA NTA at all, your husband is a petty control freak NTA

You also work a lot of hours at home! He shouldn't be waking you up. He shouldn't have woken you up before making this meals either. NTA

> He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself

If he’s home he’s not working. He should be expected to do some chores - being a stay at home mom doesn’t make you his servant where he does nothing at home. It’s also incredibly rude to wake you up just to serve him food.

> he complains I'm not doing enough 

Sounds like he has some pretty fucked up ideas of what it means to be a stay at home parent. I also wonder if there is some superiority at play here because of the type of job he has.

> He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger

He choose not to eat. You didn’t block him from getting food - this is the equivalent of a child trying to hold their breath to force you to submit. It’s just way more fucked up here because he’s a grown adult.

> just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point, 

Not being treated like a servant and having your sleep interrupted is a pretty good place to make a point. You also mentioned you were exhausted, so it’s not to be petty either.

> He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this 

No, you’re not. He’s an adult. And you aren’t even expecting him to make his own meal like every other adult should be capable of - you’re just expecting him to reheat the food you already prepared.

> This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.

I think you should be prepared to take the kids and stay with your mom if possible. The way he’s treating you isn’t acceptable; you’re supposed to be his partner, the person he loves - not his servant. Just because he has a paid job doesn’t mean what you’re doing isn’t also hard work. Hell, if you were working you’d have to pay someone to watch your kids. (And to be frank it might not be the worst idea for you to return to work - it would give you a measure of financial independence so you’re not totally dependent on your spouse.)

Marital counseling might also be an option. Frankly as an ambulance driver he should probably be in therapy anyway, those guys see some stressful shit - and I wouldn’t be suprised if lashing out at you was from not knowing how to deal with it. No. Not an ass. I mean I got 3 kids (6,2 and 6 months) and make sure dinner is done for him when he gets home. But I also know that if he needed to he would make himself something or reheat it. It’s not expected of me to do it. He makes dinner some nights. Or we just order food. NTA, he is lazy and using his job as an excuse. Im a paramedic and even when I’ve been up for over 24 hours I come home and make my family breakfast and spend half an hour or so with them before I go to sleep. You’re an asshole for referring to an EMT or possibly even a *PARAMEDIC* as an “ambulance driver”. NTA for everything else NTA- throw the whole husband out Nta what a crybaby NTA

Your husband is abusive and controlling.

He does not love or respect you. You have 3 children Yikes. NTA. Run! NTA. 

After reading only the title, the only valid reason for husband is if he is physically handicapped and could not reheat dinner himself. 

For crying out loud, how hard is it to put his plate in the microwave?!?!?

Husband needs to time travel back to the 1950’s and marry Jude Cleaver. NTA.  With 2 very small children, I guarantee you work harder than he does.  Please get help, whether alone or together.  This is abuse and is not ok.  You don't have to live like this.  His behavior needs to change before your children start picking it up.  You deserve better! NTA Why did you marry this tyrant? He needs to go. He has ZERO respect for you and your need for sleep. NTA

 ""Oh look! The PREMADE food that's already been cooked! Oh, here it goes in the MI-CRO-WAVE, oh did I just close the door on it? Gasp. And I pressed a button! Look at that, it's reheating. Golly gee willikers that was exhausting!"" 

In all honesty don't do this since it sounds like your husband would snap. OP, your husband does not respect you and isn't treating you as if you're his wife/equal. I want to say he's treating you as the help but even the help is treated better than this. SAHM DOES NOT equal that you're home relaxing the entire day. He's exhausted after a shift? So are you!!! 

I'm not sure what to say to you right now. You're most definitely NTA. You should reconsider this marriage. I don’t believe you because anyone who is married to an EMT or paramedic would never call them an “ambulance driver” except to be insulting. NTA

I hate to tell you this OP, but you're a SAHM with \*3\* kids. NTA. This is what you get for marrying young... I'm assuming from this story that he's recently turned 18 and fathered a kid at 14 or 15. If not then he needs to grow up... and learn how to use a microwave. NTA. You not only do a lot of work taking care of your kids (and I’m sure 1000 other things) while he works odd hours you also already took care of preparing his meals and the least he can do is reheat them and let you sleep.  You’re a team, he’s not your boss. NTA. Obviously this post is about one instance, maybe it was a bad day? If this happens even a couple times, I would consider addressing the behavior. He acts like you owe it to him, because he works and you’re a SAHM. While people can have the relationships they are happy with; this would be a major red flag for me. IMO, things like this cause major problems in relationships, counseling is great to learn how to communicate, before things get bad. You are his partner, not his servant. I know NOTHING about EMS shifts, I imagine they are long and arduous, like firefighters, nurses, er dr’s etc. I would also imagine he sees a lot of horrible things. It doesn’t give him the right to treat you poorly. Definitely let things cool down and talk it out. NTA.

It only takes about a minute to reheat a meal and only one button to push. Give him a class on how to work the microwave and divorce papers to show that he is now certified in handling a microwave. NTA, dude you need to re-eval. You should go with the kids to your mom's house. This isn't normal. It isn't right. Sleep deprivation is considered torture for a reason. Nta, your married to a two year old Idk what’s worse the fact he doesn’t really care about what you do or that he is a first responder that’s supposed to help people. NTA but start recording or set up a camera to catch these interactions. Have this in case things get even worse and you need to leave.

He thinks you have it so good, play it back for him and show him exactly how he treats you.

Being a SAHM is not easy. It's extremely difficult. You are supposed to be resting when you can. Willing to bet that if you or the kids woke him up while he was sleeping he would lose his shit NTA, listen I'm and emt and I work 24 hour shifts on the box and even if I've been running all day with barely any sleep. If I get hungry I stop at gas station and heat up my lunch, if I go home i dont bother my chick about that I heat up my food sit down and talk with her for a moment before i head back out. If he can't pull food out a fridge and press a few buttons to eat, then let his ass go hungry. he'll learn real quick how to use that microwave.  You already got two kids to worry about you dont need an overgrown third. DEFINITELY NTA!!! If the acts like this with you I bet his patients LOVE him…

NTAH NTA - 

Your husband is an adult - if he goes to bed hungry, that is his problem (and his fault) not yours.  You made the meals and placed them in the fridge - a child could reheat a meal - which means he definitely should be able to as well.

Does he not know how to reheat it? May be a stupid question, but there are people who don't know how to do certain things as it has always been done for them.

Also don't feel like you should have done it since you were already there, you were there because he was yelling and you thought something was wrong. As far as him saying he works hard all day - what does he think you do? Yes, you are at home, but it's not like you are sitting there watching soaps and eating bonbons. You are taking care of the kids and the house - it's not too much to ask him to reheat dinner. 

I agree with other replies - you need to think about having a long conversation (possibly involving a neutral party such as a marriage counselor) with your husband. This is completely mental abuse and manipulation. Op should immediately seek help. I can’t believe you had kids with this man but I did the exact same thing 😩 it may not seem like it now but one day you’ll be able to pick yourself up and leave with your children. This is not okay at all. I’m thinking about you 💕 NTA

Youre husband is a lazy misogynist. Yeah, do not reheat his food for him under any circumstances. If you do it once, he’ll think he can manipulate you into doing it again and again. Honestly, treat this the way you would if it were your 3yo having a tantrum. Let him have his fit, don’t let it get to you…after he calms down, hopefully you can have a grown up conversation about it. If not, stop making food for him all together and seriously consider what you should do about this long term. You’re a mom now, you’re primary job is to protect those babies. If you are hurting, so are they.

Edit: NTA NTA

I’m the worker with a SAHM lovely lady.

I’ve worked long days, into the nights, and on the weekends partially.

Even with that, I still carve out time to do *something to help* around the house like vacuum, mop, dishes, trash etc.

This “person” can’t even heat their own dinner?

To that, I give a non-sarcastic laugh.  Weak.

Imagine being a “man”, but powerless to heat your pre-made dinner. You are raising 3 children, not 2. NTA, he is. NTA. He needs therapy. I can only imagine the shit he sees in his day. You are married to an abusive controlling male  NTA.  Why on earth did you marry a barbaria? He's rude, selfish, and arrogant.   I feel sorry for your and the kids. Tell his stupid starving ass to go to McDonalds on the way home then. NTA! NTA.  Wtf?  I’m not an EMT, but I do work 12 hour shifts in healthcare that have extended into up to 16 hour shifts.  And I still have to go home and either cook, or swing by a fast food place, if I want me and my elderly father to eat.  I’d be ecstatic if someone made me home cooked meals I could just pop into the microwave to reheat whenever I want!  It takes literally no effort whatsoever and four minutes at the absolute most to nuke refrigerated food.  This is sheer entitlement on his part.  And for him to be yelling at 11 pm when you have two small children he could wake up?  Hell no! Your husband is a large toddler having a hissy fit. He needs to get help with his anger management. You are a sahm not a servant. My wife was a SAHM. I worked 90 hour weeks at the peak of a project.

If I came home, and dinner wasn't started yet, I would do it. If I noticed the floor was dirty by end of week, I would jump on that on Monday. 

I'm not saying this for praise. I'm just pointing out this is a normal behaviour for a ln equal partner who doesn't see their spouse as an exploitable resource. 

Your husband is out of touch. 
It's not the 1920. 
Fun fact: Women are human too. NTA op.  Keep an eye on him so that behaviour doesn't escalate. NTA. My stepfather is a a truck driver who gets home at odd hours as well and my mom is a SAHM with older children, and if he gets home at a ridiculous hour, he picks up HIS own food or makes something small when he gets home. Hell, he will even sleep on the couch so he doesn't disturb my mom! I cant imagine her having VERY young children and having to do what OP is. But also my mother wears the proverbial pants in the relationship so if my SD had even suggested that his testicles would be in a jar in her bedside table. NTA. You have a 24/7 job ams work just as hard or harder than he does. and he can reheat his own fucking food. This has so many red flags all over it!! I work with women post abuse and this is classic abuse. I can't contribute anything else above what has already been said, OP is been treated as nothing more than a slave. NTA. ESH, or this is fake. 

Calling a Paramedic\EMT an “Ambulance Driver” is incredibly insulting to those working in the field. 
Any wife/family member/friend would know this in the same regard you wouldn’t refer to a Teacher as “My husband is a professional babysitter” or as a SAHM wouldn’t call yourself “A homebody”


If this is true, you should probably call his employer and let them know of his actions so they can talk to him and see if he has some underlying PTSD, as Mental Health and the safety of families at home are taken extremely seriously. 
However, anyone who is married to a Nurse/Police Officer/Fire Fighter/Social Worker or Paramedic should already be well aware of all of this. 

Either you are leaving out big parts of the story to only mention the food, or this is fake. 

If true….ESH NTA I don’t even need context he can reheat his own goddamned dinner. I can just say one thing, Toxic. If he thinks that he cant even reheat dinner for himself because he has worked the whole day the why should you have to even cook the dinner when you have done the same. I know that some people think that stay at home parents arent a job but it is. With this said he is the asshole for treating you like he does and beliveing that he should have specal treatment just because he gets payed to do his work You don’t have 2 babies you have three. He needs to grow up. NTA. What a big fucking baby. I agree with the idea that if one partner works and is the sole income then the other should take on most of the household responsibilities. But you’ve done that. You prepared dinner, he just has to go get it and push a couple of buttons. This is a major red flag IMO. Why does ""stay at home mom"" always seem to mean ""stay at home slave who I get to command at all hours of day or night because when she protests I always get to pull out the ole ""well you don't work so you need to serve me right now""""

This is why I'm wary of it and would NEVER do it myself. 

NTA obviously What the actual fuck ????? Your husband is really throwing a tantrum not to reheat his own food ????? He's a paramedic yelling at his wife, not a billionaire shouting at his personal chef.  Does he really think he is so important that he can't put a dish in the oven or microwave?

Who does he think he is?  What an absolute prick. NTA. But you're being an A H to yourself by staying with him. You need to get away from this man as fast as is humanly possible. NTA. 

These types of attempts to feel more masculine will always be hilarious to me, “I want to feel like a man so I’ll make my wife treat me like a child.”

He’s not your 3rd child. He’s a grown man who can reheat his dinner on his own. Marriage and parenting is supposed to be a partnership, not one spouse wanting to be “served” by another. Its very telling that he has no problem waking you up from sleep you desperately need just to do something he can do by himself in 5 mins. This is about ego, and you should speak to him about it. NTA and like so many posts here I am genuinely concerned that you think this is even something to ask. People who love and respect each other don't yell at their partners over stuff like this. NTA, reheating a meal is easy to do. I fear for people he's helping while out in the field. NTA.  The husband is a toolbag and TA.   He goes from being a functional adult at work to being a baby at home?   You already have two children and don’t need a third.   He needs to be grateful that you make his dinner! Your husband sounds about as grown up as his children. NTA. Get out ASAP. NTA. But I have to ask, was he always like this? If not, I've seen posts where people that do a complete 180 out of the blue turn out to have a brain tumor. If this is out of the blue, please think about seeing if something is happening medically.

If this is something that always happens, get couples therapy, or get out. Wishing you and your kids the best. NTA he accuses you of being petty when he is the petty one. Listen to me. You husband is a massive asshole. NTA!!! He almost passed out from hunger!? And that's your fault? How is a full grown man unable to feed himself? I don't care how hard he works, it's pathetic that he can't reheat his own food. Sounds like an entitled ""momma's boy"" that never actually grew up. What would he do if he was single? Starve to death? NTA.  I use to fly around in the military, frequently pull 20hr days.  I never woke up my wife for anything.  Hell, I'm embarrassed by your husband...he gives men a bad name. NTA.

leave your childrens with him for a weekend(or just a day) with everything they need and let him take care of them for a weekend and see how he fares. You go relax and have fun. 

That will teach him a leason how hard and exhausting it is take care childrens while doing all the house works. NTA. Having been in a marriage where my ex refused to eat at times when I didn’t want to cook for him, don’t let your husband manipulate you. Cooking meals ahead of time for him to reheat is incredibly thoughtful, but as others have said, this isn’t about the food. His behavior is 100% about controlling YOU.

I gave my ex 15 years to be a better partner. He never rose to the challenge. It’s unlikely yours will, either. All you can do is set boundaries around what you’re willing to sacrifice for him and risk his wrath, or leave.

You and your babies deserve better. I would strongly consider leaning on your support system for help getting out. Best of luck to you. 💜

ETA: I wanted to reinforce someone else’s comment that it’s a bad idea to try to get him into marriage counseling. He isn’t interested in being a good partner to you, so it will only give him more tools to abuse you. It’s totally worth it to get counseling for yourself, though, when and if you can. Buy some really cheap and scratchy toilet paper and use it next time he commands you to wipe his butt for him. NTA. Your spouse woke you from a nights’s sleep after a long day without adult support of two young children to demand and berate, fight and blame. All over not pushing the buttons on a microwave. Do you think that’s a reasonable reason to disrupt your sleep? Do you think the issue is really about buttons on a microwave?

It is much deeper and much more troubling than that. It puts you in harm’s way. He’s trying to control you. Make you doubt yourself. Make you blame yourself. Make you feel you’re responsible for his actions, habits and emotions. 

He just told you “you made me do this”. You know what he’ll eventually do? Punch you in the face and tell you you made him do that too NTA

He sounds manipulative, abusive and overall mean to you.

Also people need to realise that being a sahm is a full time job already, 24/7. He should be greatful that you were even able to meal prep for him while taking care of his kids. My husband is a firefighter/EMT and works 24 hour shifts at one of the busiest fire stations in the city. He never expects me to be his slave. In fact, most of the time he goes out to get ME lunch/dinner. That’s what a real man looks like. Please reevaluate your situation and consider getting out of you can do so safely. This goes beyond food, this is control. NTA NTA. BIG RED FLAGS 🚩🚩🚩🚩

This is abuse! He clearly hasn't heard the phrase ""if momma ain't happy, ain't NOBODY happy."" My hubs is a firefighter/paramedic....brave enough to run into burning buildings, smart enough to know not to play some dominance bs game with me. Hold your ground, he can eat it cold or not eat....either way, not your problem. NTA. ‘pass out from hunger’? why can’t he just reheat the food it takes like 5 mins max? NTA
Your husband seems to think that he's one of the children. You're a stay at home mother, not stay at home slave. Waking you up to do something he could have easily done himself is unreasonable, going hungry rather than putting a plate in the microwave is a stupid power game. NTA

You DID make him a dinner and provide him an alternative and he is treating you like a slave. He interrupted your sleep to do it too because he's selfish. 

I would also bet that his hours are more consistent than he lets on and that he's either cheating or hanging out with his buddies without your knowledge. 

Watch your Financials closely. Get a part time job. Have your own bank account. He's controlling and abusive. 

I would be so disgusted that I wouldn't be able to touch a 'man' so incompetent that he woke me up to that his meal like a fucking servant. Gross. DANGER DANGER DANGER!!! 
NTA but this set all my warnings off. NTA.  He sounds like your 3rd toddler honestly.  Bulk cooking and having stuff ready is perfect for this situation.  Having you get a good solid 8+ hours while tending to very young kids is important.  

Dude sounds like a control freak.  I might say something like, would it be helpful to put instructions on the counter for what is available before I go to bed because taking care of 2 very small kids 24-7 with a spouse working odd hours is not a small thing.  But no you absolutely not have to be this guy's kitchen servant at all hours at his beck and call.  He is DEFINITELY being the AH in this situation.  I might do marriage counseling if this is a blocking point. Definitely not the asshole he needs to learn to heat up his own god damn food it’s not a womens job to do that and he shouldn’t expect it to be Hardcore NTA, if my 8 year old knows how to reheat leftovers, your husband can absolutely reheat his own food!! 

Also, if anyone came into my house, yelling, after I got both kids to bed, there would be hell to pay, if they woke the kids up. I don't care how old the kids are, and I don't care if said yeller is related. Op you’re NTA. This is weaponised incompetence and as other have said is completely about control. Expecting you to heat up his food when he’s more than capable is ridiculous and shows a huge lack of respect for the responsibility and work of raising two young children. There is no way this guy hid this behavior long enough to get married and have 2 kids with him. He actually yelled at midnight for you to serve him dinner and risked waking up your 2 children, the only 2 babies that are supposed to be there, and actually went to bed without eating instead of actually adulting long enough to heat up his dinner. There’s nothing that will make this better. Please.  You went to the trouble of making him a meal, and he has the nerve to pretend that it is some sort of exhausting chore to stick it in the microwave/oven/pot to heat it up.  It would have taken less energy for him to heat it than it did to make a scene like he did and scream at you. He's ""ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that \[you\] should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner."" You are working taking care of your kids. Just because it is unpaid doesn't make it any less work. I'm sorry back it sounds like the 6-month-old isn't the only baby you are being expected to care for. He's lame. You're NTA. He sounds like a caveman you’re supposed to be there as his beck and call. Was he like this when you were dating Nta
On his next day off, leave him home alone. He can take care of two kids and cook his meals and then we’ll see how easy your life is compared to his. NTA OP your husband is misogynist. you're his unpaid worker not his partner NTA. He's perfectly capable of reheating his own meal, he just wants you to do it because he needs to feel like he has power over you. And bellowing at you from another room to make you come running? That's how you'd summon a dog, not another human being. 

As others have said, this is 100% and abusive relationship and I'm sorry you're in this position. > he works odd hours and comes home unexpectedly, he expects dinner or lunch ready whenever he gets home, whether I'm sleeping or busy with the kids. It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works.

NTA, repeating what everyone already said about this being abuse, but just adding: it sounds like you work a lot more and harder than him, without breaks. You don’t owe him shit. NTA, Get away from this man. He is abusing you. NTA, you were kind enough to prepare food for him. LMFAO wtf does he think he is I have a broken ankle and my girlfriend makes me microwave my own meals when she’s sleeping. 

This guy makes me so angry, what a douche, take 3 minutes to fed yourself. Oh my god, what an awful and manipulative man. No where in the entire post were you TA. You sound like a wonderful mother, do your children a favor and don’t have a horrible role model like him around. His callousness and confidence in disrespecting you is genuinely chilling. Please get some help OP. You are NTA NTA, stand your ground on this one. Don’t engage in arguments, he more than capable of reheating his food. This response is worrisome and childlike. He needs a reality check and fast. The OP is NTA in this situation. She tried to make her stressful job a little easier by premaking her husbands meals. His behavior when asked to heat the meal himself was unacceptable and childish. It's okay to have a bad day, but it's not okay to take your frustrations out on someone else. I disagree with the comments that say she should leave. I think there is always two sides to every story, and that the OP and her husband need to learn how to talk to each other, or maybe even get a therapist or counceler. 

(My BIL was a first responder who saw some utterly devastating and disturbing thing while on the job. Years of witnessing car accidents, domestic violence, shootings, stabbings and all the other atrosiuos things humans do to each other resulted in him suffering from PTSD which really messed him up. Before getting treatment for his PTSD he tried to micro-manage almost everything at home because he felt it was the one place where he COULD control things.)

I'm NOT condoning the actions of OP's husband! I just think they need to re-access the divion of labour in their marriage, remember why they fell in love and got married in the first place, and learn how to communicate (in a respectful way) with each other. 

Stress can be a marriage killer. It's always sad when a family falls apart, and I wish this little family all the best!! Holy sh*t, he’s an a-hole.
NTA NTA send him back to his mommy since he needs one so bad. He can’t put food in the microwave? My 10 year old brother can do that, and has been able to for years!  He’s trying to get a slave out of OP. My spouse and I both work all day 8-5 but in the evening one of us chooses to make dinner for both of us because we’re both hungry and we care about the other person. OP you ALSO have a job as a SAHM. It is exhausting work too. Why doesn’t he prepare some meals for you, the dutiful mother of his children?? DIVORCE HIM IMMEDIATELY!! 
All of the abuse red flags are flying on this one NTA, this shows how he treats your current arrangement. That because he's the one working and providing money, literally EVERYTHING ELSE is your responsibility. Wtf a six month old alone would be enough for him to reheat/make his own food. Even if you had no kids! 

NTA he’s being ridiculous and you should see if you two can get to the bottom of why you must do it for him NTA. Did you marry a toddler? NTA....You work 24/7, his lazy ass can make his own meals.  I’m an ER vet who does shift work (including overnights). My shifts are often minimum 12 hours long and I have a 1 hour commute each way. 

I make my own dinner. 

Your husband sucks. NTA NTA. Reheating food is not hard at all. NTA - He seems to be confusing SAHM with HW, and then further confusing HW with butler. Microwaving a meal is not a chore, and you are a SAHM with 3 kids, not 2. NTA Sounds like you have three babies, not two LOL.  Can't even feed himself? Fu$# you are nurturing 3 people, i have 1yo boy, i work wife is SAHM, she gets tired of chores and baby care, now double the equation to 2 kiddos and a demmanding husband, crap my wife she asks me to serve my meals when i got home i get mad cause i want to serve myself i dont want to be a burden on top of my baby and i help take care lf the little boy anytime.
My advise is, ask your husband to ask for a free day and let him take care of the two babies and the house, he wont last to the end of the day LEAVE HIM >He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point,

So what you're saying is that your husband pulled the equivalent of holding his breath to get his way?

NTA. It's literally *more work* to wake you up instead of popping his own food in the microwave 1000% NTA!  Your husband has a rage problem, and the way he is treating you is abusive.  Please get out of there as soon as you can! NTA. I think reheating is fine, and he should get over it. You shouldn't have to tend to every little thing he says. However, i don't think it's ridiculous to want some dinner after he works and you don't. 

I understand you're taking care of the kids, but if you're going the traditional route, I'd want some food too. Forcing you to reheat it is ridiculous, and him not being able to do a single chore is ridiculous too. I'm not saying you have to be his servant. But if he works crazy hours to earn a living, and this is what you signed up for, i don't think it's ridiculous to expect a meal. Husband is asshole for sure. As a working husband with a stay at home spouse i fucking hate men like this. Marriage is cooperation and taking care of 2 kids and a house is hard work. He's not a baby, sure sounds incompetent though. NTA - OP's husband is being a big baby and acting like an entitled control freak. I'm sorry you have to take care of three children at home. When you should have a second parent willing to help out. And literally be able to take care of themselves. 

NTA. OP, NTA. 

I work in the healthcare field. My hours can be unsociable, I can get called into the hospital at the drop of a hat for an emergency. I could be home at 4pm, I could be home at 2am. 

When I get home, I cook my own food. I go upstairs and stick my head round my kids bedroom door, and I stick my head round my bedroom door. Then I leave the child and my partner, who has been home all day with my son keeping on top of chores and washing my work uniform because he is wonderful, and I let them sleep. 

I do this because firstly I am a grown adult and capable of cooking. Secondly, because i respect that staying at home with the kids is not a break, it’s not a holiday, and my partner has worked his backside off all day, too. 

You are being manipulated and abused. Dodgy work hours is not an excuse to order your spouse around. Dodgy work hours is not an excuse to come home in the night and shout and wake the whole family up. A stressful job is not an excuse to take it out on the people you’re supposed to love. 

I doubt your husband will willingly talk to you about this, so personally I would have an exit plan in place. This man clearly doesn’t care about your well being, or your children’s. He’s willing to disrupt the only bit of sleep you all get because he won’t put a meal (that’s already been shopped for and fully prepared by you) in the microwave. 

You’re worth more than this, girl. So are your children. 

Good luck. NTA

But you might want to change the premise of the post, as it's clear that there is no husband involved but rather three kids. NTA, OP. And your husband’s super controlling and manipulative behavior is wildly alarming. Even his babies’ well-being is secondary to his ego. Very concerning, OP. You and your children deserve someone who actually considers your needs, instead of solely his own. NTA
Honestly he sounds like a huge douche and I'm sorry he's too much of a child to simply reheat food when he gets home regardless. You're taking care of the babies, that's a shit load of work and you have his food ready and him wanting you to reheat it just cause he's tired, fuck him NTA. You got THREE kids not TWO. If my dad ever did that to my mother she would have popped him. You need to divorce him and find a man Does he not know how to use a microwave or something??

NTA

My petty ass is stuck between wanting to walk him through it step by step like a toddler or just completely ignoring his tanrums in the middle of the night. Get up when the baby wakes up and give him shit about making more work for you, then go to bed once baby is back asleep again. Chastise him like the child he is acting like. But that's just me. No advice intented. NTA… bro sounds like a big fucking baby that wants to be in control, if I get home that late I’ll let my queen sleep. 

I can make or order my food I’m not married yet, so I very likely don’t know what it’s like, but I often read posts about a SO ‘expecting [something] to be [done/ready]’ and it makes me think, damn there’s a lot of people who it seems have never I suppose had to support themselves. I get someone working hard, and in return you helping out with other things, but if I were to come home and food wasn’t made, there’d never be any expectation for anything - I’d just make my own damn food. In fact, I’d make it for my SO too because there’s probably a good reason it wasn’t made if there’s a break in the normal pattern. I don’t know y’all’s history and situation, but from how you present it, it sure seems he could be giving you a lot more grace. Relationships, in my perspective, too often get obscured as what the other person does for you, when I view it as it should be you doing your thing, and the other person complementing that experience while also doing their thing, and as a team enjoying life together. Does he think you're at home NOT working or doing anything important while he's at his job? I'm sure taking care of two very young kids and maintaining the house work like cleaning and doing laundry takes a lot of time too.

I get the sense that he doesn't respect what you're doing at home. You had HIS children and you're caring for them. You even took the time to premake him some meals. I feel like he doesn't care so much about being fed, and rather he likes the power he has over you by you physically serving him. By him heating up his own meal, he doesn't get that satisfactory feeling of control he gets from you catering his needs. If he, a grown adult, wants to be taken care of, he can go back to his mommy.

If I were you, I'd start looking into getting a part time job, even if it's something you can do from home, that way you can start establishing yourself financially. Consider what his true motives are in your relationship and if that's how you want to let yourself be treated.

NTA. Reheating his own food isn’t a chore.  It’s regular adulthood. NTA NTA. You’re in an abusive relationship. If you have someone or somewhere safe to go, take your kids when he’s at work and run. Divorce him. NTA obviously but wow at the comment section, this sub is such a joke NTA. You are married to a spoiled child. There are literally children who will come home from school or wherever and heat up the meal that has been left for them with no fuss. You are caring for 2 young children all day and he acts like what he does is the only job that counts. I don't know what his deal is but he is being outrageous here. My husband is a ambulance driver also.  If I’m not home I tell him figure out dinner yourself.  If I’m home and I don’t feel like making dinner I tell him to pick us up something. How could you marry someone like this? I’m sorry for your kids. NTA. You’re a SAHM, you work 24/7 with very few breaks in between for rest. God forbid a grown man nut up and microwave his damn food. NTA. 

But how do you not see that your husband is abusive piece of trash? It’s bewildering. NTA. You're looking after a baby and a toddler. You need to get as much rest as possible. He is perfectly capable of putting a plate into the microwave for three minutes. “Ambulance driver”

….you mean he’s a first responder? I’m in EMS, and I’d barf if my spouse called me that. The vast majority of us really hate being described that way. Just saying, but all that aside… 

NTA.

I literally walk in your husband’s shoes with the long shifts, odd hours, and getting burnt from both ends constantly. We are way overworked and ridiculously underpaid. Job satisfaction in EMS is not great.

But…. I’ve also been a SAHM before (10+ years).

You did him the favor of meal prepping. I cannot begin to tell you how jazzed I would be if there was food waiting for me when I got home and all I had to do was just reheat it. I would be so grateful that rainbows would be firing out of my ass.

However, I don’t think this is about food. EMS workers see some really horrible shit fairly frequently. If this behavior isn’t normal (which, he’d still be a giant AH for), you should really consider urging him to seek help. A lot of us have ridiculous overreactions to really dumb shit because we are struggling, and a lot of times it manifests via anger. He really may need to step out of EMS or get himself a therapist so he can handle it better. 

Either way, you’re definitely NTA. NTA please talk to a professional about getting help because I honestly believe you are in an unsafe situation. NTA. Are you married to an absolute child? I think even children behave better. What a narcissist asswipe of a man. Why are you married to this complete and total asshat. You are most definitely NTA in this situation but you need to get your head on straight and realize this isn’t a loving marriage. He’s a control freak and it will only get worse. Your life will have some challenges when you leave him, but not as many as you think. Believe me, it’s the right thing to do.
NTA
NTA
NTA Jesus Christ, I don’t really get how people can think this kind of behaviour is normal. I guess it’s a cultural upbringing thing probably but, if a group of my friends plus my family and I would watch what went on last night in your house as though we were watching a movie we would already be able to see that this is a bad sign and it will only go downhill from here. NTA NTA - you’re his wife, not his servant or maid. HUGE red flag behavior. If he is so tired from his job that he “almost passed out” and couldn’t reheat his own food, that’s his problem and maybe he needs to find a new career that isn’t so demanding of him. But it’s not actually about that, it’s about wanting to be “man of the house” so he can boss you around and yell at you. Does he yell at his kids and make unreasonable demands of them too? If he doesn’t yet, then he will moving forward. Get out and get help getting out if you need it. Good luck. NTA

As a man, this behavior is just revolting. First of all, to be clear, both of you are working full time jobs. Caring for a 6 month old and a 3 year old, mostly on your own all day is one HELL of a job. So don’t let him use his work to justify his behavior. You’re not a maid, you’re not his slave, he can and should be doing these things for himself. You already went above and beyond by preparing meals days ahead of time for him. He is acting like an abusive jerk, based on what you have said, it sounds like he has kind of always treated you this way. I would definitely talk to a divorce lawyer OP, or give him the ultimatum to attend couples counseling with you, and fix his act. NTA
What a petty lil shit that husband is. Married people are supposed to support EACH OTHER. You did not sign on to be a full time servant simply do he can have the lifestyle he wants for himself. You didn't choose to be an ambulance driver. He did. He can figure that out alone. ""Ambulance driver"" lol. He's a paramedic and I sure hope he doesn't treat his patients like this. What a worthless dirtbag. Your husband is a pathetic baby and doesn’t deserve you even cooking for him. NTA NTA NTA
What gets me the most is that he said he almost passed out due to hunger and that it’s your fault. It is NOT. He is an adult who is perfectly capable of taking care of his own needs. You went above and beyond to help him with that, and it still wasn’t enough. He is SO wrong here and using ugly manipulation tactics. 
I feel so bad for you because I’ve been there. I promise it won’t get better, no matter how much you do. You can be superwoman in every way, and he’ll still find something to complain about. It’s not about you, it’s about him. I hope you two can get some help. NTA but y’all’s relationship sounds pretty fucked tbh NTA!! Well, I gotta say you’ve got a lot more self restraint than I do. He’d be wiping a plate full of cold food off his face if he woke me up at 11 to MICROWAVE something. He is being a baby. Hold your ground. If/when he is single he will be reheating a lot of his own TV dinners. NTA NTA NTA!!!! You found a way to accommodate him and yourself, and have worked very hard to ensure he doesn’t have to lift a finger. For him to be so petty and nasty is manipulative and mean. Seriously. Huge red flag. You didn’t do anything wrong here. I come from an abusive house and I can vouch that THIS is the shit my abusive dad did. Don’t put up with it. He is not the only adult having to work and most adults dont expect to have a maid cooking for them. You are not his maid. NTA.  Some people should take lessons in being an adult. NTA. It sounds like your husband is trying to control you. If he’s incapable of reheating his own dinner then he’s not looking for a wife, he’s looking for a mother! NTA. You’re his wife, not his indentured servant. NTA. Omg. This is a horrible husband.  Lady no. He can’t reheat food?!?!!  My father was a surgeon and would come home alllll crazy hours and reheating was how he survived. He was heating and reheating at 3 am all the time. My mom NEVER got up. And he’s no peach. But at least he could heat up food. Run. What a total DICKHEAD! He has NO RIGHT to treat you this way, REGARDLESS if you are a SAHM. You are not his slave! I'd pack my shit, take the kids and leave.

NTA. NTA — you’re a SAHM not a slave. Who did you marry? This certainly is not the first time he’s acted in this type of demanding inconsiderate and juvenile way.  NTA NTA. He probably did reheat the food and eat it but then said he was going to bed hungry to make you feel bad. He’s acting like a spoilt child, not a husband or father. Y’all need counseling or extra help to break his mindset on you being his 50s wife. I’d see if you and the kids can stay with your mom for a bit so he can see how good he has it when you’re there, and staying with your mom might give you the break you need. Nta. Please read Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft. I was able to read it through the Libby Library app. You can get book free through the public library with an app. NTA, HE is starving HIMSELF to be petty and prove a point. He is severely mentally abusing you. And yelling when the kids, including a baby are asleep? He's either an idiot or just the biggest asshole.. Nta. Work is never an excuse to disrespect a spouse. Heating a meal is hardly an onerous chore. Stand your ground NTA

What would he do if he didn’t have a wife and kids? He’s an ambulance driver so he’d still be working his odd hours, but would also need to do ALL his own chores. Being sahm is a job in itself, and one that never stops. He’s being petty and extremely entitled. The audacity to wake you up from your sleep after having taken care of two kids both under the age of 5! NTA sahm is a job as well and he doesn't understand that. This is a nice compromise any appreciative husband would like. He's an asshole and you shouldn't put up with that This is sick. He absolutely needs a wake up call about how to treat a person, much less a person he's supposed to love and that cares for his children. NTA Here's a dirty little secret OP: You're working harder than he is.  It's not hyperbole, it's not to make you feel better. 

You are working harder than he is.

&#x200B;

NTA. Take the kids and run. NTA you guys need to talk about the power dynamic. He’s coming in thinking you serve at his demand since he’s out working. This needs to be addressed. Hta. And a lunatic. Just curious where he works and if he’s a volunteer … because my husband and I work the Las Vegas 911 system for over a decade and even when we’re dead busy we can still eat something… hospital break rooms, hospital cafeterias, we can bring food from home, and if we have time, we can go to fast food or a supermarket for something quick.  He can come work in our area and he can see what busy is and still manage to eat. NTA this is a power dynamic issue. You guys need to talk about this out in the open. He’s got some expectations that don’t match with what you are doing. This is a monster OP created. She used to wake and reheat, now she stopped cold turkey.
I agree they, as a couple, need counseling to work this through, as spoon feeding 3 babies is not sustainable! NTA. He's gonna have so much fun cooking for himself when you leave his ass. NTA  
What a freaking baby. Yes it is extremely heavy work both physically and mentally working on an ambulance. I know. Been there done that BUT if he thinks he doesn't have to heat a meal up on his own is he in for a rude awakening. I think that is ridiculous. What about all the single crew. Do they just starve? He needs a swift kick in the arse. NTA.   JC, your 3 year old is better behaved than the whiny ass baby your married to.
A lot of people work a busy 8 hours and have to come and make their  own dinner.
I work with nurses that barely get their break and aren't going home to dinner on the table. 
NTA NTA, but your husband is. My bf works 10 hour days outside in the dirt and mud, and if I’m not feeling up to cooking one night, he is fully capable of making ramen/a sandwich/etc AND does it without complaining. You’ve already done him a huge courtesy by making homemade meals for him to reheat. Tell him to grow up! Of course you’re NTA, but why can’t he call or text when he is on the way home? It seems like you would be happy to heat up his food if you’re not busy with the kids or asleep. If he gets no answer then he knows he’s going to have to get his own food ready when he gets home. Wth are you his wife or maid? Nta NTA Genuinely shocked and concerned at this guys behaviour. Red flags OP. What a pathetic child. Do you also have to wipe his ass after he shits because it’s after work and he shouldn’t be expected to do a chore? If I were you I would stop making his food all together. He deserves nothing from you. Nta. Divorce You sound like an amazing Mother, and your babies are so lucky to have you! I am so sorry you are dealing with this, and by no means are you TA. At all. 
This is not okay behavior, and you deserve to be treated like the wonderful, caring person you are. Your babies also deserve to see their Mother treated with love, and respect from their Father, not this.
I wish you all the positive vibes and I really hope everything works out for you girl NTA.

Everything I wanted to say I have already read in the comments. Please take those facts and advices very seriously.

Please keep us updated NTA. I despise it when people use the ""I've been working all day"" BS against their partner who's a stay-at-home parent. SAH parents are also ""working no stop for an entire shift"", and even during whatever down time they may have, they're expected to be ready to jump up and cater to someone's needs at a moment's notice. 

I mean, for God's sake, is your husband not capable of taking something out of the fridge and throwing it in the microwave? He needs to grow up and understand that you're his wife, not his mother. He thinks you're his servant/slave.  NTA I'd GTFO if I were you. NTA, OP. You should tell you just finished your shift too and need some sleep. You might also mention he’s too old to be throwing tantrums. I’m surprised he didn’t threaten too hold his breath until you got his dinner ready. NTA
He is an immature ****, you'd better leave before it's too late, it won't get better NTA but your husband definitely is. Who would reheat his dinner if you weren't there? He seriously thinks that because he works that means he shouldn't have to do literally anything else? Does he even wipe his own ass at this point? hita Definitely NTA. He could reheat his own dinner very easily, but he feels you OWE him that. He's furious--because you asked him to take a simple task off your plate so you could get some rest? That's a big red flag. I'd consider reaching out to your mom or other family and staying with them for a while. Yelling in the middle of the night isn't good for your kids to be around, either. This is abuse. NTA, he sees you as his servant, not his partner, and it seems he expects his wants to come before your needs or your children's needs. Fellow Ambulance Driver here (though as an aside, I'm a Paramedic, and he's a paramedic, or an EMT, or whatever, ambulance driver is kind of demeaning). NTA at all. I work weird hours, but my partner and I cook together, or she cooks hers, and I reheat when I get in if I'm on a weird shift. His attitude is awful. NTA it sounds like he sees you as the nanny/maid he can sleep with. He doesn't see you as a partner only a dependent that has to cater to his every whim. I'd run NTA. 

Your spouse is a giant chode for expecting you to wait on him hand and foot after you spent time preparing food ahead of time. It takes virtually no work to reheat food that is already packed and prepared.

In all honesty fuck this guy. I’d leave because I’ve been through enough abuse and trauma for a lifetime to put up with this stuff. 

OP you’re going to have to draw a line and decide what’s acceptable for your relationship. I’m nearly 40 and I’ve had enough relationships and dealt with enough abuse to say now where my line is. 

My suggestion is to seek help. If he refuses then that should be enough to say enough is enough. Imho he can die of hunger if that’s the hill he’s going to choose to starve on. NTA.

Jesus, he should be grateful you had left some dinner for him in the fridge. And if there wasn't because you were busy with the kids he should man up and make something himself.

God, I've come home from work and seen my wife exhausted, napping after a hard day and NEVER did it cross my mind to wake her to put dinner on the table.

As others are saying it's a red flag. If this is how he behaves on this situations, there are others where is support would be a lot more required, and could have similar or worse outcomes. NTA - Get out of this marriage Screw him, you are not TAH. He is a grown as man he should be able to work a dang microwave Please leave this man. They don’t change. This is only the tip of the iceberg. He is abusive and is gaslighting you and controlling you. WhT he does is wrong and frankly he’s no better than a small child. 
Tell him to grow up and get a grip on himself. You are not his slave, he is a grown man and you already have 2 children to care for. If he wants a mother he should return to his!! Or treat you with respect. You do not stay with this man if he refuses to respect you. 
Freezing you out, silent treatment, trying to shame or guilt you for his unwillingness to do for himself is part of the abuse. You deserve better and you are worth so much more! You are an amazing mother and an amazing woman and he will try make you think no one will want you, but trust me, plenty of men will be interested when you are ready. That is why he does as he does. Because he knows you can do better. My ex was the same. I’m finally happy with a decent man. I’ve gone no contact with my ex finally and my life is at peace Wtf would he do if he was a single man living alone? 

Maybe OP should give him the chance to find out 🤷🏻‍♀️ NTA! What is wrong with your husband. He’s clearly not the only exhausted one? You have a life to live too. Being a SAHM is no small feat and I’m not diminishing his efforts as a paramedic (my husband is one too) but what’s he’s done here is cut off his nose to spite his face, in the name of trying to control you. Really immature. I don’t even make food consistently for my husband to reheat after crazy shifts (though I absolutely do when I can) and he understands this. We manage it by getting a meal delivery kit that is easy to make and affordable. We work together. He sounds like he’s working against you :( NTA 

Your husband is abusive. What he did was verbally and emotionally abuse you. He also aprinkled gaslighting in that. 

You need to get help quickly. This can escalate from words to hands very quickly. The most dangerous time for a victim is when she/he leaves her/his abuser.  Mine ended up stalking me and verbally expressed how I should die (at his hands.) 

Please confide in someone who can help get your children and you safe. Then you can figure out your next steps. 

None of this is okay Nta. Wtf that man is horrible do NOT tolerate that. He's a fucking adult and can feed himself. NTA but I really hope you're thinking really hard about why you're married to someone like that I’d be so happy to reheat a meal that someone else made for me cause I’M A GODDAMN GROWNUP!  The audacity some people have to think they deserve to be waited on is appalling.

Edit: NTA So he doesn't think that what your doing counts as a job?! Probably thinks it's a piece of cake.
You have a big husband Problem and if you don't change something now (boundaries or divorce) then I promise you eventually he will wear you down and your life will be depressing. Nta Bruh it takes a minute or two to take out food, put it on a plate and reheat it in the microwave. The food is already cooked. NTA and your husband sounds awful NTA, does he call you to wipe his booty too? He needs to grow up NTA, your husband is acting like an abusive, immature jerk.  Yelling from another room to wake you (and presumably your kids) to reheat food?  Refusing to simply reheat food and instead “almost passing out” and “going to bed hungry”?  What a baby.  Sounds as though he was babied by his mother and now, surprise, you’re not his wife but his new mom. NTA 
🚩 
this sounds like abuse. NTA. If I were your husband and worked odd hours with a stressful job, I would be *grateful* that you took the time to make me meals that I could reheat at my convenience. Any normal husband would. This is not normal behavior. This is an abusive power play. Guess he’ll starve. What a loss to humanity. 

NTA. NTA your husband needs to be kicked out of the house. He is the AH. 

I'll tell you one thing. My grandma was born 1920. She was a homemaker. She lived in the country and had a house full of men who worked in the fields or the stables or went to the market or whatever. She was responsible for meals. Now, husband, BIL, grown up children, field-hands... almost none of them came home at the same time. Shifts and chores in a big farm vary, and sometimes it's harvest time or some other crazy season where you can't keep regular hours. 

So she prepared a meal and set the table at 11:30 and would start cleaning up at 14:30. That was it. You came home when you came home and you ate what you found in the pot, more or less warm. You would eat and say thank you and not bother the poor woman with ""you trot here and heat my soup"" or ""why is this old and not freshly cooked"". And I am talking rural society... 80 to 60 years ago. My grandpa was an old fashioned man who had lived his whole oife within the boundaries of well-defined gender roles, and he would NEVER have dreamt of speakig to his wife like you just described your husband spoke to you.

It wasn't just a matter of basic respect, it was also a matter of practicality. He knew (they all knew) she wasn't home doing nithing, she had many responsibilities and to interrupt one member of the team (a family is a team) and tell her to wake up or stop doing lawndry or baking or whatever else she could do in those 3 hours, in order to come and do something as useless as ""serving them"", would go aginst logic and economy. And so they didn't.

Wake up, honey! You are not getting fair treatment. NTA OP, your husband is a fucking child and you shouldn’t put up with that shit for even a minute. Can’t even reheat his own food, smdh Hey OP, please Google “weaponized incompetence.” NTA. I felt absolutely sick to my stomach reading this and old memories came flying back to me from my own experiences in a different relationship to yours but with the same style of behaviour. 

Honestly, my only advice is to GET RID of this man. I know others are suggesting therapy but personally, I wouldn't want to be with someone that I've had such horrible experiences with and who has such a low opinion of me that he feels he is in the right when he disrespects me like that. 

He's treating you as a servant and not as an equal partner. Hanging the fact that he works over your head and how he demands you do everything for him when he's home is downright awful! Where is the partnership there? All I can see is controlling and abusive behaviour. That is not loving, that is not respectful and there is no appreciation towards you there at all. 

I'm sorry you are going through this and hope some big changes are made for a better future for you and your kids. NTA
But you need to get out of this marriage. Like yesterday.
He’s a control freak. Go to your mom’s with the kids. See if he manages to survive without you there, pampering him. NTA. Sweetie, he doesn’t want a wife and partner. He wants a bang maid he can control. This will take more than you to fix, and in the end, he doesn’t want to be fixed, he wants you to do all the fixing, with him not being fixed, but you doing all the managing of him because he is a grown child. 

Ultimately, I don’t see your marriage lasting unless you choose to become his permanent doormat (I don’t recommend it). I’m sorry he’s like this. NTA. I'm a physician, my husband was a SAHD for a while. guess what, there were plenty of days I had to cook dinner for the whole family after getting home from a long shift. You are not his slave. Your job is childcare, not husbandcare. NTA. You already do more than enough taking care of two children. He's an entitled asshole and a misogynist gaslighter. Gosh - this is an unkind man.  
He's very demanding and controlling.  Nobody I know would wake someone up to make meals, and not get an earful  !!  
And nobody I know would side with him on this awful behaviour!  


Very strong NTA NTA.  OP he doesn't see raising your kids as a job.  He doesn't care that, in order to take care of *him* you had to interrupt the care for your children and/or be sleep deprived.  He knew you were asleep when he started yelling, and knew if he woke you up, he'd be justified in forcing you to reheat his dinner.  When you stood your ground, he got pissed and lashed out.

This part is important so I'm bolding it because it is clearly what he thinks:

**Your primary duty in your relationship with him is to take care of** ***him***.  **Your self-care and the care of your children comes second to what** ***he*** **wants.  If that results in you being sleep deprived and depressed, SO BE IT.**

Why are you still married to this person? NTA are you sure you aren't a sahm mom to 3 children because that's how he is acting NTA Nta
 
I straight up want to fight your husband after reading this
your husband is such an asshole. NTA

This is abusive behavior from your husband. OP did everything right by prepping meals to make her life easier while having it also make sense for her family. I also respect how she’s standing her ground and DIDNT go heat up her husband’s food just because he was douchey and mocked her. She 100% didn’t deserve to be woken up twice either…

However, I’ve gotta play devil’s advocate. It sounds like her husband is going through some serious burnout. Everything “thinks” they know what paramedics deal with, but people truly have no idea unless they see it first hand. I’m sure he doesn’t come home and unload all the traumatic shit he’s had to deal with. Being a paramedic is exhausting (emotionally, physically, mentally), it sounds like he could deal with some therapy. A lot of PTSD goes undiagnosed. Just a thought.

And unfortunately, OP’s husband seems to be taking it all out on her- which isn’t healthy or fair. But I think counselling needs to be considered before people suggest that he is controlling, or that she needs to leave. NTA. I would divorce him, it will be easier to have two kids rather than three. NTA- He’s trying to blame you for him going to bed without eating?! What did he do for the hour before coming to yell at you again?! It would have been 5 min of that for him to stick food in the microwave and heat it up. He would rather starve himself so he can scream at you and belittle you while you try to get some much needed sleep 

He’s a major AH and honestly… this is most definitely abuse. Does he do anything around the house? Does he help with the children at all? Does he do anything for you? Do you get time to yourself? If he’s willing to wake you from sleep at 11pm to feed you I bet he doesn’t let you have much time to yourself. What a useless waste of air your husband is. I’d be so far gone from that relationship. Hopefully you see this for what it is and either force therapy or leave the abusive jackass NTA this behavior will continue and it will escalate almost guaranteed. I would say take your kids and leave while you figure out your next move. With all these people saying that it's abusive, I HOPE you realize it is and do what's best for you and your kids. NTA

Your husband also sounds incredibly abusive, and I would recommend you get yourself and your kids out of that house immediately. He's only one step away from hitting you, at this point, and I can't imagine the abuse he'd eventually put your kids through. Jfc, I just realized an ex would purposefully deprive me of sleep. I stayed way too long because I just didn't have the energy to leave. Don't take an abuser to therapy. Gather up your babies and find somewhere else to be.

This is really disturbing behavior. My ex never hit me, but I was constantly afraid he would. Reading your story, OP, my mind immediately jumped to him escalating if you refuse him again. INFO: How long have you been married?  NTA - you are a stay at home MOM not in-house servant. 

Your job is to care for your babies and that’s it - not be a slave to your husband. NTA. Also idk if anyone has pointed it out. But if he continues to give you the silent treatment then that’s emotional abuse. He should also be ""expected"" to take that elitist attitude, walk out the door, and change it before he walks the fuck back in. (NTA) Honey… you need to read “Why Does He Do That?” You are being manipulated and controlled. Don’t let him do that to you. NTA. You’re with an abuser. And before people give me the “oh that’s not abusive you’re overreacting” bullshit, it absolutely is abuse. He thinks he’s entitled to being serviced, and he’s berating her and guilting her for punishment and trying to keep her compliant. NTA he's being abusive towards you. NTA. He's not only a petty narcissist, but he's trying to weaponize incompetence. Don't play his game. In fact, call him out on it, be sarcastic even. Tell him that you didn't know  he was incapable of using a microwave. Ask him why he never learned to use one. If he still pushes back, tell him that you tried to meet him halfway, but since that's not enough, he can prepare his own meals from now on from start to finish. Eventually he will have to cave. If he tries to guilt you after he caves, apply the brakes, full stop.

💗 NTA. I'm a SAHM too and while my husband doesn't work odd hours, he never expects me to cook dinner or even have it ready when he gets home. Some days he even suggests eating out because he knows that some days I don't feel like cooking. And get this, he actually cooks meals too. So just because you are a SAHM does not mean that he should treat you like that. Heating food up is not a hard thing to do. NTA

What a little princess he is. Your husband is abusive and controlling. You need to get some support because this behaviour is absolutely not okay. You look after his kids all day, I assume you do all the housework. His job might be very intensive but that does NOT mean he gets to come home and yell at you to get out of bed to reheat food for him. It’s gross behaviour and HE is an asshole. How about this? Let him get so hungry he passes out. And when it starts affecting his health and work, he can explain to his doctor and colleagues that he's like this because as a grown man he cannot reason himself to heat up a dinner that was made for him. He's pathetic. NTA. Of course you’re not the asshole. NtA. Your husband is abusive and entitled. He doesn’t see what you do with the children and the household as real work. Only his work is real work to him. That’s why he expects that you act like a servant. NTA Jesus man. Dont get me wrong, if hes out working all the time you sshould definitely have something for him to eat when he gets home. But putting a prepared meal in a microwave for a few minutes is no different than getting ice for your drink. Hes being way overdramatic. NTA but am I the only one who doesn't think this 

guy should be in any area of healthcare? I’ve known several ambulance drivers and their work is no harder than anyone else’s.  In fact they can go a whole shift with no calls.  And do you know what some of them do when they’re at the station ready to go in case of emergency?  They cook!  Big batches of food for everyone!  But even if he was carrying stretchers with heavy people on them over mountains of snow and ice, so what?  He could still heat his damn meal!  Surgeons do it, presidents of banks and countries do it, etc. And does he think female ambulance crivers go home and wake their husbands to heat their meals for them?  He’s not entitled and he’s not special.  What he is = controlling and abusive.  And by the way I’d like to see him stay home for a week with a todfler and a baby, and I bet you do all the cleaning and laundry too.  Talk about exhausting! NTA!

There are so many things going on here. First off, being a stahm is more than a full time job. When I’m off for a week I can’t wait to get back to work because nothing is harder than dealing with children all day.
Second, he’s projecting on you by saying you’re making him hungry by being petty when he’s the one being petty by trying to control you and making you reheat his meal. 
Third, he’s starving himself to be a martyr in order to try and punish you when all he is doing is starving himself. “Oh no, he’s going to bed hungry because he CHOSE to not put a plate in the microwave and hit a couple of buttons that would take him 15 seconds at most.” Even if you reheated it in the oven you just hit a few buttons to preheat and pop it in. You’ve already gone above and beyond making meals in advance. 

You should tell your husband that you’re going on a girl’s trip and he has to take care of the kids while you’re gone. Don’t prep anything for him, just let him handle it himself. I guarantee he can’t do it. 

You’re a saint OP, but you need to take a stand for yourself and tell your husband to put his big boy pants on and start taking care of himself. NTA. I would honestly pack up the kids and leave. Can you pack up the kids and some stuff and go to your moms for awhile to figure things out? If he acts like that over heating up a supper I can’t imagine how he would react to a serious relationship discussion. Especially if the discussion has to do with how he’s treating you. I have vibes that he will seriously  “snap” if you confront him on your own. 
If you can’t or won’t leave then seriously consider packing a “just in case bag” of stuff for you and the kids and leave it at your moms house if she lives in the same city as you. Keep all ID, health cards etc. with you, set up your own bank account and stash money even it’s a little bit at a time. Record/video him treating you like this if you can, if it’s too risky then don’t. If you do record him, make sure phone is passworded with something he can’t guess. Call a lawyer even if it’s  just to ask “what if “ questions. Seriously I would have an escape plan. This is abuse. Be careful. OP,

NTA

but we're going to need an update on this. just sayin'. NTA  
There's no way ambulance driving would leave a person so tired he can't even reheat his food. Seriously, you only need to put it into the microwave and turn it on. It's not that hard of  a job. This post was so horrifying, it made me feel a bit sick. Your husband is horrible, abusive, and has an emotional age of about 6.

NTA Girl. I’d be throwing that premade meal in the trash in front of his god damn face. But I’m petty. NTA, and let him starve That’s some narcissistic abusive what-about-me-ism. Dude can eff right off. You’re a partner not a service provider.


Edit: NTA Aside from money, would your life be easier without him? If so, move in with family and tell him it'll be permanent if he can't change. >\>He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point,

Look at the framing here.

&#x200B;

>He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out.  
>  
>This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.

&#x200B;

This is textbook manipulation.  If you didn't exist he would've fed himself. I mean he fed himself before he met you.  NTA. NTA. Get a lawyer and divorce this abusive AH NTA but I wish I could hear your husband's side of the story. Sleep deprivation is a common tactic of abusers.

NTA but there's a whole host of red flags. Nta. But your husband is. Wow. I don't know what redeeming qualities he has but I see so many, many red flags that it makes me sick for you. Because this isn't abt reheating his dinner. This is abt control. Abt him thinking its your duty to wait on him, hand & foot. Even if you are a sahm & not bringing in money, you still have value & you still contribute. And that doesn't mean he is relieved of all responsibilities & obligations. He should be helping with the kids so you have breaks & he has daddy time. He should be helping w some light chores when he gets home & half on his days off. You work 24/7, for no pay, no appreciation, no breaks. And he thinks you should be heating his food?!? You deserve so much better Lmfao. Reheating dinner is a chore? You are NTA and your husband is trying to be a control freak. Run. Don’t walk. Run. 

NTA. 

🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 Take your kids and leave him ASAP Lol this scenario sounds like something that would happen in our house with my parents, except the fact that my mom works a full time job (earns almost as much as my Dad) and still is expected to do everything.

NTA btw. I would ask you to get a divorce, but if you are from my country (and this situation strangely sounds like something that would happen here), I don't think divorce would be an option for you. 

Take care, OP. This isn't even AITA material you are clearly NTA, I'm sure you even know that. NTA. He can operate an ambulance but can't use a freaking microwave? He spent more effort complaining about this than it would have taken to do it himself. And then he went to bed hungry because he was too stubborn to do it?   
NTA. Run far, run fast. GET A REALLY GOOD DIVORCE LAWYER. OP, your husband is an absolute dick sucking arsehole, and that’s being polite about it. Any person, male or female who shows such little respect or thought for their partner that’s sleeping after a hard day caring for 2 children doesn’t deserve a damn thing doing for them. The way he speaks and treats you is disgusting. A grown man who can’t reheat let alone make himself some food is an absolute joker!!! NTA, I am wishing you the best OP, people have said it all already but I’m going to reiterate that you are not to blame. You are a lovely generous humble and beautiful soul and I’m sorry this person has used that against you. NTA. I hope you have someone in your life that can reassure you this isn’t normal. YOU ARE ALSO WORKING ALL DAY AS A SAHM. Fuck this dude. He’s just trying to control you. I’d literally pack up my kids and go to my parents. See how he does with nothing and no one. NTA at all, tell the misogynist to heat his own damn food or else he gets no food at all 🤠 NTA. What I'm hearing is that he's entitled and acting like a baby. He accepted the terms of the dinner then whined about it when it came about. This reads so comically abhorrent that I almost think that it must be exaggerated or fake. Who the fuck comes home at an arbitrarily late hour, wakes up their SO by yelling from the living room, throws a hissy fit about food, refuses to use a fucking microwave, and then guilt trips their SO by saying they’re going to just go hungry. No fucking way. If that’s real, he’s actually just batshit crazy and a complete and utter AH. NTA gosh no.  You've done all the work, portioned it out.  All he has to do is press a button.  He is ridiculous.  I know other shift-working spouses who do this. Nta for any reason whatsoever Run run run he wants to control you. NTA He’s not being unreasonable, he’s being abusive. NTA. NTA and your husband is being ridiculous. Coming home at 11pm and expecting his wife to wake up and heat up his plate. Two minutes in the microwave, he would have to wait the same two minutes whether he or OP put the plate in the microwave and turn it on. NTA. He is a grown man. He can work an oven/microwave easily. I worked from 7am to 8pm the other day and still was able to reheat food left for me from St. Paddy's Day dinner. I didn't need anybody to push any damn buttons FOR me, nor did I feel the need to tell and complain about being hungry. NTA.  I have words but they will get me banned.  You know this is no way for a spouse to treat their SO.  You have a husband problem that needs working out, I hope he will work with you.  Good luck. NTA.  If I go to bed tonight hungry due to not heating up my own food is that your fault too?  Cause it makes about as much sense. Nta.

If a grown man can't do something so easy he needs a reality check. Thr next time he does this I would personally put a bib on him and treat him like a little baby. Act like a toddler be treated as such! Seeing things like these...

How do women not notice clearly abusive behavior, does it really start overnight?

Do you not know what abusive behavior is?

Why do you make kids with such men?

Why do you put up with it? 

Has anybody ever told you he might be toxic and not worth it, any friends? Why did you not listen?

I am genuinely baffled...I want to say NTA but I also think that, at this point, if you ignore this, you deserve to be treated like shit. NTA in the slightest. I work full time at a laborious job and still manage make all my own meals plus my girlfriends. He can pop a plate in the microwave NTA. 
However, as a former paramedic, I can say they don’t like being referred to as “ambulance drivers.” NTA. You're making the meals, all he has to do is stick it in the microwave. How would he manage if he lived alone? Quick response No It’s amazing that he can work on an EMS crew with broken fingers and arms. 
NTA NTA. I know everyone on here is saying try to reason with him,  ect, but that never will work. He is so far beyond the realm of reason. He sees you as his literal live in servant, nothing more I'm sad to say. I know he won't ever be reasoned with, but im worried that if you even try to make a stand it will turn into physical abuse. Then that will be the new norm. He's going to do whatever he thinks he needs to do to control you. My best advice his while he's at work pack some things and go to your parents house. Save yourself and your children from years of abuse. Lol 

My dude knows there’d be something in his food there shouldn’t be if he pulled this 

NTA if he has a stable schedule then expecting dinner when he gets home is conceivable 

He’s still a bad person 


And still abusive 


But that’s a possibility at least 

But he doesn’t tell you when he’s coming home but expects dinner ?

Nope 

He can use a microwave or he can starve. 

NTA 

you should leave him though 

Because he’s a bad person a bad partner and I’d bet money he’s a shit father too. NTA If my husband screamed at me and woke me up to heat up his dinner, he'd be wearing that dinner! He got dressed all by himself this morning?

NTA Like many people said already, this is abuse.

Messing up with your sleep schedule on purpose is a form of abuse itself. Making you  drop whatever you're doing to  cook for him is absolutely ridiculous.

Being a sahm doesn't mean you're his personal cook, nanny, or s*x doll. He should still do his part of the chores and be a decent human being towards you. 

Refusing to simply put a plate in the microwave proves this is just about controlling you.

NTA and I'm begging you to consider these redflag seriously Wtf. NTA!!! You are working twice as hard as your husband since you are running an entire household by yourself. If he wants a maid and a chef then he can hire them to take care of him since he clearly needs a mommy. Interrupting your sleep schedule and your time taking care of two small children is abusive and controlling. It might be time to consider staying with somebody else. Edited to add that the entire time that he spent throwing a tantrum could have been used to heat his own dinner. Your husband is a fucking asshole.  You’re NTA, obviously.  What an entitled prick. OP
 
Be very very careful. 

I think you may be in more danger than you understand. Get out. 

NTA. NTA.  When he gets home tonight tell him you want a divorce. You dont have to explain how you want to be treated. He can work hard and pay child support if he cant act like a godamn adult So.... let me get this straight ..... This is a full grown adult we are talking about? NTA - What kind of idiot 1) wakes up his wife to reheat a premade meal, 2) starves himself for an hour and then bleats at her again to wake up and heat it up for him, 3) goes to bed without eating, and THEN 4) leaves home without breakfast? 

Answer: an idiot who gets to go back home to his mommy and see if she'll wait on him.

Don't get sucked into this trap, OP. Give him the boot. WHAT DID I JUST READ?!?!??

It takes max 5min. to reheat a meal in the micro. This guy is just petty and uses his job as an excuse to be like that. I work odd hours and live alone but I do my own meals etc.

NTA.

This guy is just full of 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

PS.
There's a LOT of us who'd be so THANKFULL of what you do for him... I just don't get what's his problem. NTA- ur husband is manipulating you and using you as a doormat. My husband uses the whiney- can you do xyz tone for me all the time and I set him straight. I say to him in my best Robin Hood men in tights blinkin voice “OH HOW TERRIBLE MASTER ROBIN, YOU’VE LOST YOUR ARMS IN BATTLE,” then I fondle his moobs and say “BUT YOU GREW SOME NICE BOOBS!” Then he says hey, stop that and I respond with… oh, so ur arms do work!! I guess u can do xyz yourself after all. 

But I seriously decide if it’s something I want to do and sometimes I’ll just leave his dinner in a plate in the microwave and he just presses +30 sec. So there’s zero reason he can’t do it himself and if he’d done it instead of being a whiney little man brat, he’d have eaten food by the time he got done yelling at u and giving you the silent treatment. If it was me I’d tell him… u know what.. u can do it yourself for a week. But be safe op, if u don’t feel safe, take the kids and go. Cos srsly not normal or healthy behavior 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If he were living alone he would have to clean his house, do his laundry, buy food, prepare it and wash up. Not to mention look after his children by himself when they stayed! All he had to do was reheat prepared food, sit down and enjoy it! He sounds very controlling and weird. Narcissism 101
NTA NTA

This behavior is controlling and abusive. Start planning an exit strategy. Do you have friends or family you can stay with? He needs to go to therapy and start showing real meaningful change if you plan to stay there. This situation is not healthy for you or your children. NTa - but your husband is having severe burn out and needs professional help. Fuck this guy. 

NTA. Wow! I didn’t know people from the 50s could time travel! NTA NTA This can’t be real. 

Seriously. What kind of marriage is this?

NTA I mean I can understand If he did not always want to eat a reheated meal, but to awaken my partner from sleeping, when they also have what is essentially a full time job, just go put something in the microwave shows me that that’s not what that was about.

Very scary and controlling, his violent outrage is especially frightening.

This isn’t about the food at all, but rather the control he wants to have over you, that you would bend over backward and conform to an unfair set of rules. NTA. This is abusive and he is gaslighting you. Please reconsider being married to someone who treats you like this. Ur NTA but your husband deff is NTA. Your husband is abusive. Your husband is a bellend. NTA. If i did this to my wife id need to sleep with my hands cupped over my balls.

And id have been wearing that pre-prepared meal for a hat. NTA, you are his WIFE not his servant. I know paramedics, firefighters, police officers, etc ALL of whom work long shifts and none of them treat their spouses/partners like this. Why? Because they're adults who know how to care for themselves. Your husband? He acts like a spoiled brat who probably learned this behavior from his parents. OP, please consider counseling for you and your husband, this is not a healthy situation for you or your kids. divorce, honey, divorce. >I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore

And does he appreciate that your shift is literally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week?!

NTA. At all. Like, not even a little bit. NTA as everyone has said. Tell that fool to buy some food and stay at work. Nta

My dad works a lot. My mom makes his food. She tells him where it is and when he gets home he reheats it. You know what happens when there isn't food ready when he gets home and mom is busy/resting? He either makes something or goes out for fast food either way he doesn't bother my mom. He even gets my mom something.

What everyone is saying is right. This is about control.

And just so you know stay at home mom is a *job*. You deserve to rest just as much as him. You're a saint, I would have stabbed him in the neck. An abused saint. Get out of there! NTA, pack the kids up and go visit your mom for awhile, lets see how often he goes hungry. He is being a grade a jerk. NTA

My husband is also a first responder and no way in hell does he expect this when I’m on break. 

If he’s on night shift rotation, I’ll portion out his dinner in Tupperware for him to have when he comes home at 6 am. He’s fine with this because he knows I deserve to rest since dealing with our 4 year old and 1 year old can be exhausting- break or no break. 

Your husband is controlling and acting like a child. I suggest couple’s therapy. NTA. NTA - STOP serving him. You are not a slave to do his bidding. He is able to put the ready made dinner into the microwave. Do not allow him to treat you like crap. Take care of yourself. Abusive abuser you have right there lady. A shame you have children with him already. NTA. You are in an abusive relationship, OP. 

You did nothing wrong at all. Question…do you honestly think you are the AH?  If you do that is really sad because it’s very clear you are NTA.  Your spouse seems to verbally abusive and sadly has convinced you that you might be in the wrong when you are not. NTA this guy thinks that he works and you don’t, that SAHM means “sits on her ass all day mum”. He has no concept of the work it takes to bring up 2 tiny kids, prepare all the meals and keep a house. is he refusing to use the microwave? I suspect this chore would be less effort than the argument. Looking after a baby is equivalent to work anyway. If he thinks otherwise he can volunteer for all baby duties on his days off, since obviously it is so easy. Wtf. NTA. Get the fuck out of this marriage immediately. This is controlling and scary as fuck. He can heat up food. He can eat cold food. Why is he trying to exert dominance over you, and make you wake up to microwave his food? This is absolutely bananas, and 100% you would be justified in ending the relationship over this type of behavior. You are not a servant. NTA

first of all, what the fuck. not only does it seem like hes using you as a fucking maid, he proceeded to gaslight you while being a major hypocrite. divorce immediately OP can offer to bandage husband's knuckles from being dragged on the ground.

H wants a ~~slave~~ barefoot, pregnant wife instantly waiting on him hand and foot (where did that expression come from?) as soon as the Lord of the Manor makes his appearance.

OP already has two kids -- and apparently married to a third! This man is a walking red flag NTA— If I did this, my wife would be very, very angry at me and I wouldn’t blame her a bit!

In this situation he is being an utter spoiled child. ABSOLUTELY NTA. 

Your 'husband' treats you like a SLAVE. Not a spouse or partner. Get out or get help while you can. He'll lead you to an early grave.. NTA. What's he going to do when you divorce his ass? Starve to death? It’s giving “the worst is yet to come.” Not only are you NTA, but you need to leave, STAT!!! NTA.   What a piece of work you have as a spouse.  At home with a toddler and baby with his weird hours.   Do not tolerate this nonsense.   This cannot be an isolated incident or situation.  I am sure as a SAHM you feel stuck in the relationship because he is the earner.  What a control freak. NTA he can reheat his own dinner. This is emotionally abusive and I think deep down you know that.

You are a SAHM, you are NOT a chef or a maid or a butler. It is your job to provide care for your children and to provide care for the general household. 

It is not your job to provide **care** for a grown ass man who is capable of hitting buttons on a microwave.

He is abusing you by not allowing you to properly rest or sleep and expecting you to be at his beck and call whenever he shows up no matter what else you have going on. 

He was screaming at the top of his lungs to wake you up, he could've woken the children too; clearly he only cares about *himself*.

Sounds to me like you need to talk to your mom about this. Take the kids, and go stay with her for a while, until he can get his shit together and realize that he's not only taking advantage of you, but this is an abusive situation.

You're definitely NTA, and you need to recognize abuse for what it is.

Just because he has a high stress job doesn't mean he gets to take that out on *you*.

I have a high stress job as a nurse, I still do my share of household shit and the majority of the cooking, it isn't my place to take my stress out on my family!

And then the emotional manipulation tactics. He's going to starve because of you, not the fact he refuses to use a microwave? He's going to bed hungry because of you, not because he won't heat the food up? He's hunger striking to manipulate you into feeling bad.

That is NOT ok! NTA. you stay home to raise his kid so he doesn't have to pay for childcare not to be his personal servant, maid, cook, whatever. He isn't your child and he can take care of himself. Ask him if he'd rather pay the bills so you can raise y'all's kids or pay you child support when you leave his childish ass. He is so much worse than an asshole. NTA. What a pretentious pr#*k. Even if you didn't have two small children that behaviour is completely unacceptable and selfish. If he can't reheat a meal, let him faint. I'm sure if his colleagues had to attend to revive him they would be astounded by this atrocious attitude. I feel for you x NTA. I'm a nurse. After a long shift I make dinner for my husband and kids. I don't expect dinner to be ready for me at my beck and call. My husband can reheat the food when he comes home if it's cold. He respects my effort. Pretty sure I know who wrote this lol. You married him and never saw this coming? NTA but girl you need to get out or get him to clean up his act. please listen to these comments. i don’t even suggest trying to fix it i don’t believe abusers can change, but at the very least we can all agree this is abusive behavior and you need to make you and your children safe for the sake of your kiddos. I used to be an emt as well. I worked very long hours and was married with kids as well. Not one time did I ever come home and demand a meal be ready when I got home because I'm a big boy. If I'm that desperate for food I can make a sandwich for myself. This is absolutely abuse. This is about control. Your husband has some serious issues and they need to be addressed immediately or they will escalate.  I've seen the aftermath of it as an emt too many times. This behavior is absolutely unacceptable. What you do with this information is up to you, but there are a multitude of resources to help you if you need them. NTA. Your husband however is a GIANT one. Having two kids that small is MORE than a full time job. You never get time off between shifts like he does. What a freaking jerk. If this is how he treats you why do you stick around??? I was a stay at home mom with a husband who travelled. He NEVER would have treated me like that and if he had I would have punched him in the nose and locked him out of the bedroom. He obviously has no respect for how hard it is taking care of two tiny ones. NTA times a million. And just think… what do all of the EMTs and other people who work long hours do if they don’t have a spouse to cook for them?

He is capable. This ain’t normal. Girl you need to divorce him.

This is not the 1950s anymore.

NTA let him starve Umm. Take your kids and run. I wouldn't of even made the dinners for him to reheat if that's the way he treats you. You deserve so much better!! Nta. NTA. Your husband is an A-1 jerk. He can take his food and eat it cold if he doesn’t want to heat it up. Honestly, ask yourself, Am I better off with or without this jerk? Your husband is ABUSIVE. Stop catering to him. If your mother really wants to help she'll give you a place to stay to get away from this controlling asshole. NTA. I work 12 hour shifts. As does my husband. When we can we will prep the other a meal. It’s not assumed. It’s a courtesy because we are a partnership. If husband hasn’t prepped mine after what will be over a 14 hour day after travel, getting up at crack of sparrows, guess what? Even though I’ll be looking after our daughter I can make my own. Your husband needs to grow the fuck up and take some responsibility. Oh wow he’s looked after other people all day. Well done him. He chose that job. Doesn’t mean he can’t take responsibility for his own sorry ass when he gets in. Sorry OP. I’d get rid of the whole husband. So many red flags here I can’t even begin to unpick. You are NTA Good lord ..  I’m a paramedic the job is beyond stressful and draining emotionally and physically…. BUT .. he has lost his fucking mind thinking it’s ok to come back after a 12/24/48 hour shift and yell at your SO because you’re hungry and tired . The whole world is fucking exhausted. He needs to get some help and check himself or you get out of there . Many of us lose our shit and never come back because of this job . He has zero right to treat you like dog shit ! OP NTA ! Nta. He does not respect you. This can't be real NTA He’s highly abusive. Get out do you don’t have to raise three kids. Then he can learn to not take you for granted So wait, he’s supposed to be capable of taking a person who just died and making them alive again, but taking a plate of ~37 degree F food to ~100 degrees by pushing a few buttons is an insurmountable task for him? Lady, you are so NTA it’s not even funny. Oof that’s scary NTA - And trust me when I say, what he’s doing is controlling and abusive. Either get counseling or I would leave him. This doesn’t sound like a safe situation >It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works

Okay, but does he know how hard *you* work?

NTA NTA - Your husband sucks so much , you spend much time to let his dinner ready and the only thing he has to do is reheat, but instead he wakes you up , could be waking the kids up just for you reheat for him , what a lazy controll man he is Anyone else think that it’s weird that he just shows up unexpectedly? I had a close friend whose mother was an ambulance driver growing up who didn’t just suddenly come home. To me, that’s another way to keep you on your toes and control you. Definitely NTA. I have a baby and know how you feel, I hope he can get counseling. NTA  
Holy frijoles! I know he's doing a job that helps others but he is awful to you. Nuking something isn't a chore. It is a basic life skill. 2 - 3 minutes to heat food and he should not be waking you to do this. Does he want you to wipe him when he going to the toilet as well? NTA. This is not healthy behavior.  He is really treating you very badly. NTA

I will never understand the whole ""make me my dinner"" mentality. You aren't his personal slave. Plus being a stay at home mom is a full time job in itself. He might have long shifts but at least he gets to come home to a loving family whereas you really never get time off. So what he has to press a few buttons to REHEAT the food? You still took the time to even put the meal together in the first place. NTA, your husband definitely is TA. He is not valuing the time and energy and work you are contributing to the family and expects you to be his personal slave to top it off. If a child can reheat a plate of food, then I'm sure your husband can also do the same. If he's that useless, then I don't know how he can even drive an ambulance! I'm betting he also does nothing around the house? NTA x 1 million. NTA... The only thing worth laughing at is the grown man who can't work a microwave. NTA he has 2 hands all he has to do is get his lazy butt up and put food in microwave and hot start geez. Did he break his arms when he got home. That's plain ridiculous and I know I'm sure his shouting woke them babies. That's a power play. If he goes and complains that his wife didn't wake late at night to make him dinner so he had to go to bed hungry tell them and say dinner was made all he had to do was warm it up because you and kids eat on a different schedule. NTA!   He's weaponizing 'incompetence' (cause we all know he can reheat food in a microwave at the very least) and abusing you AND the children.

Daddy pterodactyl screeching at mommy to make him food and waking them up is scary. It's abuse. Daddy verbally and emotionally abusing mommy? Leaves mental scars on children. How long till daddy goes after them for not serving his royal ass?

Get yourself and your children out before he scars them for life. I'm one of those former kids. They are likely to end up and stay in an abusive relationship, because they will think it's normal.  
NTA

You're working while he's away, not lazing about. 

When he comes home and is off from work, the burdens of home and childcare should be split as it is incredibly unfair for him to get breaks from his work and while you get none from your own. Why should you be on call 24/7/365 for three children ? Did you marry a two year old? That's the only thing I can think of that would explain that tantrum. Is this a case of he is the only one with a real job because he gets paid, but you don't because you stay home having an ""easy"" time taking care of the children and the house? Screw that. You're working hard, too. He's being a selfish pig. NTA. NTA. I think Ive been in this sub for too long. After a while here I now think half of America are AH's or the stuff I read here, including your husband. Nta
This is abuse 
He's a grown man, he can feed himself. NTA but you married a control freak. Get yourself a job and be financially independent. Even if all your pay goes to daycare.. get out of the house. You’re basically a slave to this guy and no it’s absolutely not normal. NTA obviously. This is one of the most pathetic stories I’ve ever read on this board. Is your husband a man or a small child? You’ve managed to become part of a vicious cycle and never should have stepped foot into that cycle in the first place. “He expects dinner or lunch”…time to nip that ridiculous expectation in the bud, don’t you think? This is 2022, not 1955. You shouldn’t be mad that he laughed, you should be mad about a hundred other things in this story, starting with his expectation. NTA and you two need marriage counseling pronto. NTA - You know what I do, when I'm really hungry? Eat a snack while my main course is warming up. Like an apple, a slice of cheese or two sips of a smoothie. Just to get my blood sugar up. It keeps me from screaming at innocent bystanders. Geez NTA, tell him you need a pay raise if he wants that kind of special treatment. Your job is to be a stay at home mom, and he's an adult, he can microwave food. I used to work 3rd shift, had a second job part time in the evening to make ends meet. My ex-husband would do this to me too. I left, took my son, went to my mom's and never looked back.

you deserve SO MUCH BETTER. Please, go see a therapist for your own well being. NTA. My dads a paramedic for 31 years and he has  manage to be responsible in making his own meals if he’s hungry.  Your husband is just being a controlling ah. 

Go live with your mom or a friend  for a while if you can do so. You are not the asshole. Let him starve. If he gets hungry enough he'll make his own food. In the meantime, you need to seriously think about whether or not you want to stay in a relationship with a man who basically thinks of you as his maid. NTA.

I don't understand... If he was not married, who would cook for him? That's right, he would do it himself! You already cook, there IS food in the fridge and he won't reheat it cause...?

No, that's not acceptable! You are a stay-at-home-MOM, not his maid! You have a job and your first and more essential work is to raise the kids. You also cook, do all the chores (as I assume from this: “He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore”), but he can't serve himself food? Unbelievable! P NTA

OMG if my wife/significant other did this for me I would be eternally grateful.

Your guy does not know how good he has it. NTA

You are not making him fend for himself, you already do 99% of the work in cooking and getting it all ready for him to reheat.

As others have said- this ain't about food. 

Please seek some help. For yourself, and for the kids. They have a 3 years old, so they've been together for a while. It cannot be the first time he acted unreasonably. What's up with this guy though? He rather starve, than warm up his own food! How ridiculous! Well if he can't even reheat his dinner (2 mins in microwave) then best not to waste food and make nothing for him instead till he learns how to do it. OP,get the kids and leave .It won't get any better,nor will he change. OP, I was in an abusive relationship for 12yrs. It was around the 9th year i started realizing it was a controlling/abusive relationship, and it took me many tries to leave—i only got out because when he finally snapped and got physical a neighbor called the cops, something he still says was “all made up to make him look bad”. This post triggered so many memories for me and so many other abuse survivors. NTA, please reach out to your support network or DM me for resources, nobody deserves this. You were mistaken, you have 3 children.  Tell your grown ass man/child husband that it is not unreasonable for him to take 2 minutes to heat something in the microwave.  But it is unreasonable to wake you up, after taking care of the kids all day. I don't think you're the ahole for telling him to reheat it because of the time of night and the fact you have a new born. Just be up a night or two each week to just be with when he gets home, so he's not eating by himself and can talk with you to help relieve the stress of having to be away from you and the kids you had together. Honestly talk to him, ask what's wrong, cause there's probably something he views as a problem in the relationship that he's not happy about. NTA.  Others have given great responses re why, and why this is an unhealthy dynamic.  I will only add that 1) am shocked that the shift to reheating did not happen earlier; 2) my father, who is the definition of male chauvinist when it comes to my mother, is totally fine reheating food because of his odd timings; and 3) the following story.

In Pakistan, the last several years have seen a significant increase in fighting for more women’s rights.  One of the milestones of this fight is the Aurat (Woman) March, and one of the main features (beside the impressive gathering, speeches, and talk about the March before and after) are the signs that participating ladies (and men) carry.  A few years back, one of the most entertaining (for me) and controversial signs was one that said “Khud khana garam karlo” (heat up your food yourself).  It caused such an outrage with so many people that is reflective of just how “insulting” certain men seem to think doing ANY kind of work in their own house is, which really can only come from the theory that men are akin to kings or gods.  

So many women both work inside and outside the house, and women working solely at home are not exactly sitting around all day (they are actually working - that house didn’t clean itself, that food didn’t make itself, and those kids didn’t raise themselves).  OP also has a six month old, so I imagine she is just as, if not more, sleep deprived than her husband.  And even if she were literally lazing around all day, waking somebody up to put food on your plate is just cruel.  It reflects the character of somebody not worthy of respect, because they cannot give even basic respect to other humans. Does… does he not know how to use a microwave? Your husband is abusive, manipulative and selfish. 
Do not give in to him. Ever. 
Document as much evidence as you can to use for yourself to help with custody when you realize you need to divorce him and have to protect your children from him. NTA. Your husband sounds like an emotionally abusive unreasonable baby man. 

Just so you understand what good looks like: my husband will often come home after a very long day at work and cook ME dinner because I've been too busy with the baby to manage it that day. Care taking for your children does not mean you are also obligated to feed your partner. Lmao is he serious? Reheating food is a chore now? Is wiping him own butt a chore too that he thinks you should be doing for him? He can stay hungry for the day, it’ll teach him a lesson maybe. NTA NTA. How horrible. Get a divorce attorney. Get as far away from that idiot as possible. His going to bed hungry is entirely HIS choice...

NTA NTA

You are on call, sort of working, 24/7 and him working a job outside of home doesn't pardon him from tasks at your home. Seriously? You say that you do his bidding because he works hard? You're raising kids and staying at home to do it so you both don't have a huge child care bill. It's not a walk in the park. He's trying to control you, and he's the AH. 

NTA You both have a really unhealthy, toxic and frankly childish relationship dynamic. Unless HE needed ambulance it not normal for a grown man to be screaming at his sleeping wife. This is disgusting behavior. NTA Reddit so quick to be like “run for the hills” when 99% of these things can be solved with like 1 conversation. I struggle to believe this is a real story. I m trying to imagine any person i ve ever met doing this. Even the worst people i can think of wouldnt do this.

Mostly because its vastly more effort to fight with someone than just using a microwave.

If its real obviously NTA yta ESH- did OP talk to her husband? This story feels overwhelming one sided to guarantee an anti asshole response. 

This sounds like something  that could easily be resolved by having an open and honest conversation. What is it with this sub and suggesting divorce over every disagreement people have in their relationships? Why are you dating a toddler? I've never heard of a adult acting this way. 

You mentioned ""expectations"" these expectations didn't come out of thin air, so in short you should never encourage/put up with that behaviour in the first place. NTA, but you should have a talk with him once you both are hopefully well rested. Ambulance driving can be difficult work and he might be working long hours (thus why he's home at 11PM). However being a SAHM with 2 young children is also taxing. You both need to have a conversation about the difficulties you both face and what you both can do to make things easier (even if it's temporarily until the kids can go to preschool or school). Also, I wonder was he too lazy to microwave his food or did he just want to spend some time with you or needed someone to talk to after a possibly stressful day. When someone's working late (especially when they are working hard for their loved ones) and they come home and everyone's already in bed it can be depressing on top of an already stressful day. I don't know if this could be your husband or if he's expects you to be at his beck and call (which would be a red flag). I think communication is the issue here.  Both of you have very stressful jobs, you stuck at home all day alone with kids and no help, him as an emergency worker who is in stressful situations all day and night and not being able to just relax and talk to about how shitty his day has been.  I think this is more about him wanting to unwind with you, the person he feels most loved and connected with.  His job is just as hard as yours and sometimes he is stuck with coworkers that are not easy to be around.  Maybe it isn't always about control or abuse but about finding some comfort with his spouse when he gets home.  You both need to find that comfort in each other and make time for the two even if it is for 15 to 30 minutes a day.  You both have had a hard day, reach out for each other and don't lose sight of the reason you both work so hard. Maybe just a hug and a kiss when he walks in the door is all he needs. Maybe is him to kiss and a thank you for working so hard all day with the house and kids. Be kind to each other. Down voted, obvious affirmation post. Definitely NTA but think carefully about how you respond. A lot of comments on here say to demand an apology, threaten to leave, etc. He will not respond well to that. 

I would let him cool down, then say that the disruption of sleep is affecting your health and this was a compromise. Cooking ahead of time so he always has a good meal available, and when you are sleeping he can just warm it himself. Leave him instructions on the best temp and how long to heat it up for (his anger may have been because he’s always had someone doing this for him and he doesn’t really know how to but he won’t admit that). 

When you are up and not super busy, you can offer to reheat it for him. Marriage is about compromise.  Cooking is part of the sahm deal imo but that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a break sometimes. Omg NTA.  even I as a boy and a teen can reheat my stuff and i dont consider it a chore. It could be either that he is being controlling, he onestly needs your help and doesebt want to admit it or he just wants to see you when he gets home from work. But even if that is the case, it does not justify him waking you up by screaming for you to do a simple “chore”. The only reason i could see that would make there be NAH is if he had like back to back or close to like 10-12 hour shifts and he was running on empty then i could see his reaction as understandable as would be tired. But that probably was not the case so NTA op. Why not just idk communicate with each other, ask him to text you when he's off work and x amount of minutes away from home so you can just reheat it and leave it for him 🤷‍♂️ NTA. Your husband probably also has a lot of untreated trauma, PTSD is common among first responders. You should probably get professional help and don't look to these comments for advice cause I have seen some really bad advice getting upvoted
But here is my 2 cent

It's possible that OP's husband might've had a rough day at work and misdirected his anger at her. He most likely knows that what he did was unreasonable and saying he is dangerous or hinting at the fact that he's abusive is just jumping to conclusions in my opinion but I could be wrong, I think OP needs to have a conversation with her husband and they both decide what's the best solution is for their problem and hopefully reach a compromise.

I don't think anyone who comes home at 11pm after a long day at work will want to cook their own dinner (for those saying he should sort out his own meals), preheating is a reasonable solution to that, another solution might be getting those food flask that hold in temperature so he can just serve himself. 

Waking someone from sleep to serve you food especially when it has already been made available is unacceptable.

I really hope you reach a compromise soon
Goodluck Thank you so much, this is the nices thing that's ever been said to me in awhile. You know it's just frustrating and sad that he thinks that every move I make is solely to spite him or control him, he always has this idea of me making light of his work and sacrifices, I gave him no reason to think that at all. And I know this is late but my uncle is an ambulance driver. He says his work consists of 80% drinking coffee and vibing and 20% driving and working hard. It’s a tough job mentally but physically really not that hard if you get over the hours. Ofc this differs per region but that’s what it’s like here. Honestly his behavior really did scare me for OP. I was expecting her to say he hit her next. What an absolute entitled asshole. I get it being a SAHM we have to do more things than women who work. HOWEVER what I refuse to be is a fucking servant. Which OP husband seems to expect. His anger was very unnecessary and the fact that he starved himself just to prove to OP that she was in the wrong is astounding. ALSO the fact that he’s yelling at night and doesn’t care about waking up the kids would cause me to throw hands. NTA... I was the OP. I was in your position (minus kids). Except my ex spent the evening at the bar (didn't work and was on disability) and expected supper when he got home when the bar closed at 1 am. He emotionally manipulated me and played with my emotions. Made me feel less than I was. Your husband is emotionally and mentally abusive. He wants control. It's not healthy, it's not safe and it's not a good example to set for your kids. Seek support and LEAVE!!! He's not going to change. You are a good woman and do not deserve the treatment that he is giving you. Don't let him keep sucking you in. You work all day taking care of kids, keeping the house clean, and even going as far as cooking supper so he has something when he gets home. The fact that he can't he comprehend that and thinks it's okay to wake you up just to reheat food is insane and so disrespectful. Please please please get help. NTA. He may work hard and work odd hours but you work hard *and you are on call 24/7 for your kids.* It would be exactly like if you began demanding that he cook a meal for you the minute he walks in the door. You don't need this bullshit. Why stay marroed to a misogynist? This sub makes me depressed at the amount of people putting up with abusive relationships with men who clearly belong back in the 50s. WTAF. OP NTA and please get out while you can. Yep. And it has nothing to do with food (food is just the mechanism demonstrating the underlying problems). RIGHT‽ What the absolute fuck This right here. I stayed in a relationship for four extra years because ""well he doesn't hit me."" His words and actions are still affecting you, and he doesn't care.

Sure, he worked a full shift. But you haven't stopped your full shifts either, because you're taking care of three other people and you haven't even had time for yourself to sleep!

NTA, OP. Take care of yourself, for you and your babies. Agreed. So husband is basically saying working non stop and being hungry reverts him into a 6 year once he arrives home, incapable of going to a microwave or oven and waiting 1 to 5 minutes to reheat food?
He's not an emperor with a servant.

With that attitude, he might as well demand OP select his entire wardrobe for the next day  (socks shoes underwear etc) and lay it on a chair. And about custody, start texting or emailing him about this so u have proof of how he treats u and the kids. Say ""I wish u wouldn't yell at me when the kids are asleep. I won't be talking to u in person until u calm down."" see if he explodes in text. Move to ur mom's if u can with the kids if that is legal? Text him u have had enough of his treatment and the kids deserve rest. I hope this is good advice, if not I'm sure people will point it out. NTA THIS IS ABUSE I’ve always found it insane that physical abuse seems to be the only “justifiable” reason for a woman to end a marriage, whereas men feel free to peace out any time.  Seriously, I’ve even known women who were shamed for ending a marriage because of their husband’s infidelity.  Misogyny is truly alive and well. Exactly. Get out before your child grows up watching this toxic dynamic and thinking it is normal, healthy behaviour. You're not valued or respected OP. Leave and show your child what a strong, independent woman looks like. Yet. He isn't hitting her YET. Amazingly when I get home from a full day of working as I medic I am completely able to fix up my own dinner. yup, this right here. a full grown adult telling his partner that she is responsible for his hunger??? that’s 100% emotional abuse. NTA Oh honey she has to leave she ain’t have a job LOL she needs to remove herself from the situation and since she to lazy to work she shouldn’t keep the house Hi, my spouse is a paramedic that works 12 hours a day and still makes his own food before he goes in and after he gets out, especially since he works nights. 

This is atrocious.

Your husband sucks, and this is not going to end well. OP he expects you to be brainwashed into doing everything for him. His world has been knocked off kilter because your mom helped gave you a solution that you implemented that showed him you aren't as in control as he thought you were. He's going to be angry with you until you beg him not to be and go back to running yourself into the ground to make him fresh meals every time he wants you to.

Do not give in to him. You are still independent from him and have a support system with your mom. If you are going to try and make this work this is a compromise HE has to make.  But I doubt he will. Tell everyone you can about this behavior now so that you have someone else to gauge his reactions and changes and will have a person to rely on when or if he blows up at you.

You still have the power here. Remember that. As soon as you falter he will notice and take advantage of your guilt in this situation.  

I agree with the comments saying you need to go but I know it's never that easy. Stay strong and have someone in your corner always. This is a great comment but DO NOT GO TO COUNSELING WITH AN ABUSER. It just teaches them to abuse you better. OP, you need individual counseling to help you navigate this, not to make him understand or make him be kinder, but to *leave*, because he is horribly controlling and he's not likely to change. This. OP, don’t forget that you *are* working as well. Getting to come home and not have to do anything except put your pre-prepared, home-cooked meal in the microwave is a seriously *good deal*. 

If doesn’t like it, he can be a single man who works and then keeps his own house. Be careful though, because the whole thing sounds like it’s more about controlling you and keeping you in your place than it is about food or chores. I absolutely agree with most of this, but please, do not try to do counseling or mediation with him. This is abusive behavior and it is a bad idea to do couples counseling in an abusive relationship. 

Get yourself help and support to navigate this. If you can’t get a therapist (make sure you find one with lots of experience related to abusive relationships), call a domestic violence hotline and ask for help. You may think that those numbers aren’t for you, they are for people in “real” abusive relationships. I promise you, they are for you and you deserve to get help. Agree NTA,

You may also want to ask yourself these questions:

Does he ever take the kids and do things with them on his days off?

Are you constantly the only one cooking and cleaning?

Are there things that only you do that both of you could be doing? Putting the kids to bed, giving them a bath, taking out the trash?

I understand that you are a SAHM but on days off and times where he is home he should be helping with these things. I am not saying it should shift to 100 percent on him but there should be discussion and willingness on both sides to give each other a break.

There are plenty of families with a parent in a busy shift work job that still find time to help out with things at home.

Please listen reflect and plan your next steps because from what you describe he may not be willing to change. I will tell you if I had pulled something like that on my partner would made me sleep on the couch, hell even kicked me out and there would be serious discussions about what would need to change if I wanted to stay in their life.

 Take the advice of the other people posting here as they are better with that part than I am.

Again NTA but he is a very big one You are SO right. 

My whole being is shaking right now after reading the OP. Trauma that I thought was healed is screaming right now. I want to add that yes, while driving an ambulance is stressful, it doesn’t always mean it is an arduous job. When I was in college, I was friends with the local EMT’s. I used to hang out with them at their station. There was a LOT of sitting around, watching movies, in between dispatch calls. Some days were hectic, others were not. Depending on where OP lives, it is entirely possible that her husband is sitting around for hours during his shift, getting meals with his coworkers, etc. Just want her to have a realistic view of what his job entails so hopefully it will get her sense of outrage going. SHE works 24/7 with the home and kids. HE is using her idea that he “works hard” as a way to force her into essentially slavery. OP, he is NOT working harder than you are. Do not let him make you feel that he is. this. he does not respect his wife and his children. wtf This is absolutely control. 

**He spent more time and energy complaining about something than the minute of effort to do it himself.**

An ambulance driver is a pretty low salary to be supporting a SAHM and his children. OP, is there a real reason you cannot work so you have financial independence from him? 

NTA. 🚩 I’m also a SAHM with kids about the same age as OP and my husband is a first responder. Not only does he fix his own meals for work, but he helps me feed our oldest and sometimes me because I haven’t sat down all day. If he  B was alone he would not only reheat his own food, but he’d prepare it, too. I agree with the above post that OP needs help. Maybe go stay with her mom with the kids? Let him take care of himself for a few days. Please please please, OP, listen to this. Your husbands behaviour is NOT acceptable, no matter how ‘hard he works’.

NTA. Yes, absolutely. But DO NOT have relationship counseling with your abuser. It will show them new ways to abuse you. I second all of this. This was my dad. Swinging shifts, plus overtime. Mom also worked full time, took care of me, did all the housework, cooked all the meals, would get up hours early before her work to pack dad's lunch or stay up late to make his dinner. All he'd do when he got home was drink 12-15 beers, then sleep the whole time, then get up an complain that he didn't get enough sleep because Mom and I made too much noise (when we were absolute church mice when he was sleeping). Mom never stood up for herself, or me for that matter, she just went along with dad's angry whims. Now I'm an adult and haven't lived with them for 10 years, but anytime I'm with them, it's still the same, even though dad retired and Mom's work is more demanding than ever. It's a seems like such an incredibly depressing life for 2 people that say they love each other. I definitely didn't get off scot free either, but their problems are much worse. Get help or get out, it either has to change big time now or it never will. NTA I 100% agree. This is one of the grossest stories of control I’ve come across I came here to say this but knew in my heart it had already been said. You should never go to couples counseling with an abusive partner, it just teaches them more ways to manipulate and abuse their partner further. This one instance sounds abusive, it is probably much worse. 


OP should definitely try to find therapy for herself, but that can seem very unattainable when you don't have much money or kids at home to care for. OP, you might be able to get a referral to a psychiatrist from you GP, who can help you find a therapist that works with your HMO. There are also low cost/no cost options in many states (if you're in the US), and with the proliferation of telehealth it's possible to do your therapy sessions from home, it's what I was doing for a while. I wish you the best of luck, OP! Chiming in: Please note that purposeless / unreasonable sleep deprivation is a form of abuse. LET. HIM. STARVE.

If a grown ass man can’t reheat a meal then that’s a him problem not a you problem.

You can do better OP. NTA - He reminds me of my dad.  My mom waited on him hand and foot for 60 years, and at the end, she wiped his butt because she thought she should.  GET TO COUNSELING NOW!  He has no respect for your job as a Mom AND, reheating a meal, IS NOT a chore. And anyway, he SHOULD be doing chores Ahhh, this gave me such memories of my childhood home: abusive. This behavior is appalling. NOT having dinner ready immediately when husband gets home? NOT magically waking up at whatever minute husband happens to come home? Where did OP learn to be a wife? /s This! so many people come to AITA asking about a specific incident, but the problem is so much bigger than who is right and who is wrong in this one event. It is totally what you said, they have big problems and to stay married they need counseling, therapy, some kind of real help NTA 

This 👆👆👆👆. This right here. 👇👇👇. That right there. These comments spell it out better than I could. Listen. That is not normal. It’s not ok. doooooon't go to therapy with an abuser. OP, please just get out of this situation as soon as you can. sleep deprivation is considered a form of torture for a *reason* Agreed. This situation is scary abusive. My husband worked 12 hour days, 5 days a week, and came home and never expected anything other than our children were well cared for. He said the house and the cooking were BOTH of our responsibilities. I can't IMAGINE him waking me up to heat his dinner. I would have thrown him out and rethought the whole marriage.

OP, this isn't normal. Do you have friends or family you can run to? Because you need to go somewhere safe. I'm traumatized reading this. Too late to NOT marry assholes.  But not too late to put your foot down and let them starve! This is appalling behavior. You are a SAHM, which is a 24-hour job and he does not respect you or your contribution to the household. You made him home cooked meals that he simply has to put in the microwave and reheat and this is too much for him? And he yells at you from another room when you are sleeping to come perform this small task. I really think you need to remove yourself and your children from this situation before it escalates. He reminds me of my moms ex husband. They love control. Physically, emotionally and financially. Once my moms new therapist found out who he is behind closed doors the therapist immediately got my mom on a call with a divorce lawyer. Her old therapist never even believed her and only believed what her husband said because thats how good these people are at lying. Sadly most people in these relationships are already under the other persons control and it only gets harder for them to leave Exactly, If he was actually about to pass out from hunger he would have reheated it or even eaten it cold if he was that hungry Absolutely all of this!!! You need to take a step back and see he is being extremely controlling and vindictive. And have a good think. Is this the type of behaviour you want your children to grow up around? To think this is in any way an ok way to treat a spouse? Right now he isn't treating you like a spouse. He's treating you like a slave. And that is absolutely not on. Bless his heart. As a sahm, OP works entire shifts all day, every.freaking.day.  NTA, and also maybe OP should look into talking to someone in person about this, for professional, objective advice. I think your advice is spot on. She couldn’t have said it any better,  NTA OP has three children, not two. Why would you want to be with someone who’s so callous and selfish? He sounds horrendous. NTA btw, you’re being extremely nice by making meals for him to warm up. If he were single, he would find a way to feed himself after those shifts. If you were gone, he would find a way to have his laundry done (I’m assuming that is another EXPECTED chore), eat, and have at least a livable space to live. You are NTA for recognizing that, while yes he has a hard job, so do you and you do not clock out. Kids are hard. I work with special needs and I understand they are two handfuls of work. But if you weren’t here, it would miraculously get done and he knows that. Don’t let him make you feel you have to do these things especially after you finally have time to rest yourself. Every 👏 word 👏 of 👏 this 👏

NTA. You are not his slave nor his maid. You are not at his beck and call. He is a grown ass adult and you found a great way for him to have meals at all his odd hours. I'm just saying that even my abusive father who my mom ended up taking a restraining order against, never made her get up from sleep to make him food. And he was a firefighter who worked all sorts of fucked up shifts. Sure he'd have us get him a drink during the day instead of doing it himself, but dang atleast he never made us wake up or stop another task to make him food, let alone reheat it. Hey OP, the *only* scenario in which this might be even SLIGHTLY okay would be if he was diabetic. 

Considering he went to bed without dinner instead of being a big boy I can tell he’s not, he’s just a controlling sack of potatoes wanting to be waited on. Mostly accurate except the counseling. You ***never**** go to counseling with an abuser. Nta!!!

And there’s no way to improve on what CTDV8R said. How long before this gets physical? I see this is borderline verbal abuse and clearly you’re husband does not give 2 shits what happens because of his actions OP: You're NTA, he is.  Let him starve. I'm sorry, what?! OP, my husband is a paramedic/firefighter. He works 24 hour shifts. And STILL helps me with the kids, to include feeding them/me/himself like a freaking adult. Your husband is abusive, and I worry that his behavior is escalating. Do you have somewhere safe you and the kids can go/access to therapy, both couples and individual? Please stay safe. I don't understand how he can be an ambulance driver if he has no hands to even push a couple of buttons on the microwave. Poor thing.

&#x200B;

OP. GET OUT. If I ever had a hot meal ready EVER again when he got home,

It’d be fucking McDonalds. OP should take note and tell him they’re open 24/7 for his convenience! :) Shit, I don’t even respond when my KIDS yell at me from another room, LOL. Unless someone’s calling for TP because they are on the toilet they are expected to come and talk to me Dave to face When I used to work dinner shift at a restaurant I got home many nights after 11 also, I never expected food to be ready for me when I got home. Sometimes there was a plate made up for me to reheat and sometimes it was a hot pocket. I NEVER would do what he did This NTA.

Talk to your colleagues and mentors about keeping your professional skills up to date so you have a smooth transition back into your career. Look at daycare centres now. You have a point EXCEPT for the counseling- never go to couples counseling with an abuser, EVER! They’ll twist things in their favor and just learn how to manipulate you better. OP you just need to leave. No salvaging this Yup. My abusive SO would do this. Lack of sleep makes you easily manipulated and controlled. He’s a grown man who can work a microwave himself The 3 yr old heard every word of that.  The 6 month old felt the hostility in the house. OP needs to protect those children, if she can't justify doing this for herself. 

He isn't starving, he can use a microwave or eat it cold. He's an abusive AH. Totally agreed, except important to note that you should never enter therapy with an abuser. Never. Dangerous game. But OP would do well to get her own therapy for sure!!! agreed. 100%. i will say that i have developed a pretty dim view of peoples unacceptable behaviour in marriages and long term relationships at this point of my life, and am always inclined to say 'f@&k that, i'm not wasting another second'. 

but if the person is ordinarily alright and you have small kids/babies a third party can help mediate or as i like to think of it 'referee' a conversation between you.

you can always get divorced and sometimes thats the best and often inevitable outcome, but at least give mediation a try Just an FYI, if someone is in a relationship with even signs of abuse,  couples counseling is not recommended. It often escalates things and makes it more dangerous for the spouse & children. All of those red flags over simply microwaving a plate of food. 

This guy seriously woke up his exhausted wife after she spent a whole day taking care of their home and family, then berated her for suggesting he do something completely normal and reasonable. Then waited for an hour, just to make another fit and blame her for his hunger. 

NTA. This guy is a piece of work. He's abusive! Everybody said it on this thread, OP NTA

Question for you, don’t you work hard? Start thinking about yourself too, you’re already working hard. You don’t need him, he needs you. I HATE comments on this sub that just harp on breaking up long-standing relationships but every once and a while posts like this come up. What the FUCK??? How has this behavior gone on so long? NTA. The only professional she needs is a divorce lawyer. He's way too far gone for counseling. Thank you for saying this so much better than I could through my need to scream ""Take you babies and run"". Maybe she's still here because she doesn't have any other choice. Maybe he controls all the finances and she can't get a job because of everything at home, including the kids. Maybe she doesn't want to be there or maybe she's been so influenced by him that she stays because she doesn't think there are better options or he'll take her kids. After a while you just get used to it and you adjust and don't realize what's happening. NTA.

He got angry because he sees making food as a task that is beneath him, expecting you to do it is a clear signal he sees you as being beneath him. I'm not sure there's any therapy in the world that will be able to change this misogynistic way of thinking.

He was way out of line even before this, always expecting you to have his food ready. I'm a (female) doctor, work all kinds of shifts, and always make my own meals when I get home. His behaviour is bullshit. So agree with you! However I do believe in traditional relationships. This has nothing to do with it. OP, made sure everything was done in the household. Sure being an ambulance driver is a hard job. But taking care of 2 young kids, and the household is a hard job aswell. OP needs her sleep to make sure everything can be done the next morning, and/or can get out of bed to comfort the kids if its necessary. Getting enough sleep to run the household with 2 young children is really important. 

I wonder what OPs husband wants more? There is plenty enough dinner prepared, he can't expect OP to be ready with whatever he wants or needs, especially when his hours are odd. control? your deeping it. he just got used it to it. Hell, in the 1950s, my dad cooked his own meals, did his own laundry and ironing! Yes to all the things people have stated about warning signs, and for persons being abused, always get out safely. 
But anyone else a little wondering if this is rage bait due to her use of “ambulance driver”? I know tons of EMT/S and Paramedics, and they HATE being called ambulance driver. I would expect someone married to one would use the correct terms. Above police dispatcher used it… 
Again, for abused persons who needed to read this, yes, advice. But just wondering on this particular issue She already DID cook for him. What a gaslighter to spend so much energy on trying to make his wife miserable instead of doing one of the most basic things for himself. NTA Next time he comes home, OP should have a high chair, binky and a spoon with baby food ready for him to ""open up for the choochoo train"". An appropriate dinner for the infant he is Right? I used to do the same when I worked an after school job as a teenager. It's not like it's rocket science to throw a plate in the microwave! Yup. This is emotionally manipulative, borderline abusive behaviour in my eyes. He is waking you up from sleep (a need) to see to his want (sitting on his ass and being served his dinner).  He is then guilting you and giving you the silent treatment to try to get you to feel like the bad guy and to cave. You are absolutely, categorically NTA and if your husband refuses to budge on this matter he is being controlling. If you WANTED to do this for him and it was agreed, that's up to the two of you. But making you wake at all hours when you are also responsible for chores and childcare 24/7 because he doesn't want to put a plate in the microwave? Nope. Not to mention that she's a stay-at-home mom with two very small children. She's literally working around the clock every day My mouth went completely agape. Like, jaw on the floor after reading this. NTA at all, OP. His behavior isn’t ok at all. I felt incredibly nauseous reading this post. Op really needs help. I agree! Im very shaken by this post and I’m afraid for her safety. She needs to make a plan and get out >Reading your post gave me chills to my stomach and triggered me into what I thought was healed trauma. 

Same. My dad was demanding, demeaning, unreasonable, and mercurial. He'd yell at us just to watch us rush around to appease him. As I imagined being woken up by shouting and subsequently laughed at, my breathing actually elevated a little. This kind of behavior is all about power and keeping someone off balance. I might do this, matter fact from now on out I might as well stop cooking for him all together. But that's my petty side if he wants to see it then why not. I'm at my wets end but he thinks I'm imposing unfair dynamics having him work then do chores which I don't BTW. This is extremely abusive behavior. He is limiting your sleep on purpose. He yells at you rather than calm communication.  He forces you to take on every single thing for you, him, your kids, and the house. Leave him. He only causes issues and if all he does is financial support then child support would cover such without the emotional turmoil. Heck, I'm a single mom and manage to go to work, come home, take care of my kids, and make all our meals.

NTA at all. I got home from school as a kid and waited for my dad to get home from work, and was responsible for heating leftovers or making a simple meal/snack if I got hungry before he got home. I was 12. I would suggest both tbh. 

What a catch eh? Ya I would have just laughed in his face and said I’m not your f’ing slave Before her it was probably his mother keeping him alive And tbh it's not even a ""chore"" What kind of EMS system have you seen?! Cause I’d love to be able to just wait for even a third of my shifts. EMS is a lot of hard work. That being said, I agree with NTA. I would be thrilled if my SO had leftovers for me to just reheat when I’m ready to eat. And who r gonna take care of ur kids?  B/c he is not competent enough to take care of his own needs, he damn sure should not be alone in charge of his kids. This is genuinely scary behavior. It sounds abusive and like things might escalate. I hope OP can safely get out. You are not kidding. 

Gave me the chills. 
>Why do his basic needs trump yours?

BeC hE wOrKeD a FuLL sHiFt wHiLe sHe WaS hOmE tHe wHoLe DaY! Not enough men are chiming in here, and I appreciate hearing your input. Why dudes want to infantilize themselves with their spouses is beyond me, but speaking from experience, that’s toothpaste that cannot be put back in the tube. God damn right. 

Signed, a dispatcher. I don’t believe this story because I have never known a paramedic who calls themselves an ambulance driver. In fact, most of them get upset at that term. Ewwww those are so expensive. It's 7.98 for 2 pieces of French toast and an egg Please, my 8 year old can heat stuff in the microwave. She also grew out of toddler tantrums years ago.  This guy is more like a 3 year old. But really, he's abusive. Also, 6 seems like old enough to be able to use the microwave on their own (though I don't have a frame of reference for this). Even a 10 year old can feed himself. Guy just keeps the cultural thumb on her. More like a toddler. Even my 8 year-old can heat some nuggets in the microwave. Maids deserve more respect than this man is giving his wife. Hopefully he'll have to get used to being hungry and single. She said it was her mom, but you are also correct on hed demand no matter the job Its insane that he went to bed hungry cause he couldnt micro the food. He needs mental health checkup Genius!  Thanks for the laugh! he literally freaked out by something that can be done in 5 minutes just pushing some buttons in a microwave WHAT my 12 year old can make KD, use the microwave, and pour a bowl of cereal. Lol leave bc the dude yelled one time after a long ass shift. Screw the kids or years of relationship let’s blow it up bc the dad doesn’t like reheated food Exactly what I thought.  Run, run, run. Yep! First responder here and I come home from my extremely busy system and make dinner for myself and my SO, clean up the kitchen, and do anything else that needs to be done before bed. Even after a 24 hour shift, I come home and make coffee and breakfast for my SO before I go to bed. OPs husband is DEFINITELY TA The toxicity....whew. I mean I was married to an EMT once too. I get they have long exhausting hours. But what would he do if he were single? Just starve? Is putting a dish in the microwave and punching a couple buttons too much to do to make your pre-prepared sustenance palatable? Because that's a really, really small ask, buddy. Especially when she's home with kids and a job that offers literally 0 time off (sahm). What you laid out in your script is absolutely what the husband Should do, but someone who acts like this is not likely to react well to a speech full of (what he would perceive as) insults and demands. It would just anger him further, and I would worry about OP if they used your script. Actually this advice is super dangerous. Her husband is abusive- having isolated her and now with her being a stay at home mom, he is the only one with financial security. These are giant waving red flags. Confrontation could lead to violence. I would make a plan to leave safely, with assistance from a battered Women’s service. When a narc loses control, it is the most dangerous time for a woman and her children. It's a nice script. But I've lived with a guy like OPs husband. He'll say ""I see"" and proceed to make her life hell until she backs down. It's a great way to tip him into swinging on her. 

It's time to pack up and go quietly, this guy is bad news. You can't reason with him because he's not acting in good faith, he doesn't WANT to change. He wants control of OP. No, this is an abusive situation and this kind of advice could be dangerous. OP needs to just get out. We have no idea what kind of reaction her husband could have to that and it could potentially endanger her safety. I am often one of those “Reddit and divorce” comments and in this post, I gotta say, this is abusive (or maybe in a best case scenario, some meaningful developmental or behavioral issue that is going untreated?). This husband needs to get right and the fact that OP feels maybe in some universe they are the AH is sad. NTA. This script is so over the top and ""I am very badass"" lol. 

This is an obvious domestic violence situation and your speech will get her punched. 

Real life is a lot more nuanced and most people don't want their asses beat by an overly aggressive man if they can help it. This script is likely to get OP killed. Most importantly, do not have this conversation in front of the kids. Confronting him is unrealistic and very dangerous advice that is likely to lead to violent behavior. Your husband is not going to change just because you tell him how you feel and what any reasonable person would expect in a marriage. Leaving is the most dangerous time in an abusive relationship. The safest way is to call the domestic violence hotline (800-799-7233 in the US) and let them help you figure out how to leave.  Going to your mother when he isn't home may be ok. Going to a secret shelter may be safer. Do NOT seek counseling with an abuser. You need individual therapy for support. NTA >and I don't want to be interrupted.

This is about how far I think OP will get with this script.

All the points you're making are fair and reasonable, but attempting a ""stern talking to"" with an abusive spouse with massive impulse-control problems when they're already fuming from a prior perceived slight is at best fruitless and at worst actively dangerous. OP just worked a 7 am - 11 pm shift plus overnights, so he needs to recognize who actually does the most work around the house. What a sack. That's right OP, talk your husband into not being abusive, great advice here.... This is dangerous in front of a child. Could backfire and end in more yelling, which is very traumatic for children. He might even kick her and the baby out. It happened to me at 5 weeks post partum. Some men will do that. It sounds reasonable in writing sure but with people like that they will take that and turn it around into them being personally attacked and then have a tantrum over it and blame it all on the other. Yup. God this man is lucky he isn't married to me. If you woke me up when I had babies, you'd be eating dinner from the wrong end. 🤣 This sounds like a script whose sole purpose is to get OP in a dangerous situation with her spouse. It's great that you're envisioning this Hallmark ""stand up for herself"" fantasy for OP, but this could realistically lead to violence. This kind of confrontation is absolutely not what you do with an abusive, immature, unstable partner. There's a reason why people in abusive situations are advised to prioritize securing safety and having all interactions with their partner be in a controlled environment with third party mediation.  


Frankly I'm baffled why this has so many upvotes. Like this is OP's life, not a movie. Just because it's a snappy speech doesn't mean you should encourage what would likely be a move with SEVERELY immediate negative consequences for OP. Add to all of this, his sex life should be done. Until he can show respect for his partner, he doesn’t get to have sex with what he’s treating as his servant. 
He’s not a man by any stretch of the imagination. That line he said about her being petty and causing him to starve is the best example of projecting I think I’ve ever witnessed. That should earn him a medal and a cover shot on Abusive Illustrated magazine I'm with the others that she should go somewhere safe before having that conversation. Having this conversation could go very badly.

The only thing I would change, aside from avoiding the ultimatum of a divorce, is that she should say that she will be getting a job, while he handles some of the home duties. He would perceive having his wife not lifting a finger for him as freeloading, and make things much worse. A side effect of her also working is that it will provide her some Independence if she needs to leave in a hurry. Basically, she can work, she can hire a sitter, and they equally share the duties at home. That way he would lose a lot of his power, and she would have the ability to leave if things go further south. Husband: okay then, you go get a job. I’m quitting mine and taking care of the kids from now on. I wish I could upvote this more than once Old school gender roles, which wouldn’t help if OP wants to stay a sahm over leaving him and finding work Agree, agree, agree. From personal experience, the dynamic between my parents changed drastically as soon as my mom agreed to be a SAHM. My dad was similar to this asshole, he didn’t eat leftovers or reheated food, so my mom would stay up to 1-2am to cook my dad a hot meal (he was a police office and worked late shifts). When they eventually divorced, it took her forever to make up for the loss wages because she’d been out of the workforce for so long. Being a SAHM is a trap. OP is clearly not a native english speaking person lol calm the fuck down. Also in some countries there are people who only drive the ambulances, they are not trained paramedics per se.  Ip: 70.692.047 Ambulance drivers still exist. It's rarer than it used to be, but they still exist and don't always even require certs. An ambulance driver is an ambulance driver. They don't require any qualification other than a driving licence. Paramedics are different. Idk how it works in your country but yeah. Not like either of those certs requires hours upon hours of training and clinicals and practicals... right? 😌 /s Thank you!!!

**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.** This is definitely real, met so many men like this and my friend was in a relationship with a guy like this who ended up breaking all her belongings and taking all her money out of spite 9000+ upvotes, 1200+ comments. A story where op is clearly not an asshole, husband is a villain from the 50’s. There ya go. This sounds like something that could easily be resolved by using one's hands and pressing a button on the microwave. She said he said ""whatever"" when she told him the plan from the get go. He could heat the meal in 5 mins. It's already made. Maybe an ESH if she had been awake. But he woke up up from a dead sleep. Hell he could have woke the baby.  How is this situa an ESH? This wasn’t a disagreement though not allowing someone sleep is used as a form of torture if this is happening every time  he works than that’s straight up abuse and she needs to find a way out. She was asleep in bed.

Working a microwave is not rocket science. Husbands the Asshole through and through. She probably cleans everything and does all the laundry too. this was 11 pm. OP was sleeping. This is an awful take. She should wake up and get out of bed to reheat a meal that she prepared for him? What in tarnation You obviously don't take care of kids to make a judgment like this tbh Oh boy. You’re about to get read to filth, friend. I’d delete this before the rest of the internet finds out how utterly ass-backward your views are. In the meantime, may I suggest you do a little reading about unpaid domestic labor and how much it would cost if you hired out for it. OP says the husband comes home unexpectedly and expects dinner when she’s sleeping. I don’t see how she’s the selfish one. Nobody wants to wake up in the middle of the night just to put something in the microwave. It’s a simple task

NTA Wow. Do you have multiple kids that you raise by yourself 24/7? Two under three? You realise a 6 mo old is exhausting, right? When the kids sleep she needs to sleep. Not be woken up to hit some buttons on the microwave because he’s too lazy and misogynistic to do so. If he had a stressful day and wanted to talk, there are other ways to get that than screaming for your dinner when your two children and wife are asleep. 

NTA, OP Wtf no this man sounds like a narcissist who will hurt her one day He says that because every move he makes is to spite or control you. This is classic projection.  An abuser will reveal his tactics if you pay attention to what they accuse you of Well, that is an abusive tactic, he’s making himself the victim so you will end up doing whatever he wants. It’s projection. All of his moves are to spite or control you and he doesn’t value your work. Since that is how he is, he assumes that has to be how you are too. He refuses to believe that someone would have good motives because he doesn’t have good motives. OP, there’s a book called “Why Does He Do That?” By Lundy Bancroft that you should read. If you Google it, there’s a free pdf version you can download. It’s an abuse tactic. This is hard to see because you’re so close to it, but this is AWFUL. Proud of you for standing up for yourself and refusing to do it. >he thinks that every move I make is solely to spite him or control him

Its projections. Its an abuse and control tactic. To spin it around and have you question yourself when it is exactly what he is doing. My ex did this. Its abusive. Its manipulative. And it is extremely dangerous to be involved with anyone who operates like this. Somehow I think I was married to your husband about 48 years ago, except back then he worked second shift at GM and worked a lot of overtime. I also had 2 little ones. We had been renting my brothers house and he had to move back to the state unexpectedly, so we moved in with my Mother, at that point, my oldest was 18 months old. My oldest brother ran the family business out of my Mom’s house. I answered the business phone all day and occasionally answered emergency calls at night, kept the house spotless, and cooked 3 meals a day every day. My, now ex, expected to be waited on hand and foot. If I made him sunny side up eggs, I did it wrong. I was told I had no idea how to fix a grilled cheese sandwich or popcorn,just to name a few. I also was told that I couldn’t cut grass worth a crap, but I needed to keep practicing ( after about 3-4 months of crappy crappy mowing, I found out that he had the wheel height different on all 4 wheels) he also constantly told me that I couldn’t drive worth a damn, especially on the highway. The little bit of self esteem I had had, he quickly demolished. It took me 15 years to perfect fried eggs, popcorn and grilled cheese, and my grass cutting skills are pretty amazing now. However, at 60+, I’m still terrified of driving on the highway, though the Sweet man, that I have been married to for 35+ years, thinks my driving is great. I just get so scared that I’m going to do something wrong.
My youngest was born the latter part of December, a few days around Christmas. The year I had him,my mother’s basement flooded because of excessive rain. I spent New Years Eve vacuuming up water and then taking it out to dump it, in the rain, just days from giving birth. He came and looked at the situation, dumped  1, 16 gallon vacuum load and then he said he was going to bed. He left me there alone to clean up all the water mess. I made up my mind that night, that my New Years resolution was to divorce him that year. It actually ended up being drug out for 2 years, because he kept wanting this or that, just stupid stuff.  He also refused to move out of my Mother’s house, though he did eventually move into another room. He acted so pitiful that everyone felt sorry for him. My oldest brother, let him rent a place he had, for next to nothing and he still neglected to pay my brother some months, and he also destroyed some things in the rental place. My brother soon saw what I had been living with. I knew that I would rather scrub the bathroom with my toothbrush and have to use it again, then stay with him for even one more day.
The longer you stay with toxic, self centered, abusive people, the worse it is for you and your kids. We teach people how to treat us and your husband is treating you horribly, and he won’t learn until he absolutely is forced to. Yeah he has a stressful job, but so do you!!!
You and your children deserve so, so, much better.
It got to a point with me, that if someone said something nice to me, I choked up and fought back tears. A sibling could see for a long time, how awful my now ex was, and he tried to talk to me, and tell me that I didn’t deserve being treated like crap, and when he started out telling me all the positive things about me, I had to tell him not to say anything nice, because I would start crying and never stop.
Everyone on this sub, is telling you that you are worthy of being treated royally. That your husband is abusing you. Please believe all these people who have been in your shoes.
You deserve so much better and so do your children. You are totally NTA, but get yourself and your kids out of there, or you will be, for messing up their childhoods. Congratulations on your new baby! And Huge Grandma Hugs from an old lady on the net. I don't think he actually believes that OP, I think he is probably projecting and telling you how he feels about you and your contributions.

At this point the only thing I can't say is whether or not you should immediately jump to therapy or if this is unsalvageable, and that is because I don't know your relationship. But either way this is not something anyone should have to deal with, and this is not healthy or sustainable. 

NTA for the bots What everyone is saying is spot on with the projection. I thought of it too with his “you’re going to make him pass out from hunger because you’re petty and trying to prove a point” when it’s literally him doing that.

This may or may not be your partner, but I finally got myself out of a 2 year abusive relationship with someone who has NPD (it goes soooo far beyond inflated sense of self) and your post really reminded me of how my ex used to treat me. And it was the same comments about never doing enough when I was sincerely bending so far backwards I felt like I was going to break. And trying to ‘control’ things and him constantly whenever I just tried to communicate on anything. I seriously felt like I was going insane and under his thumb until I learned about the disorder, the symptoms/signs, the different tactics they use to manipulate people and their partners. Everything clicked once I finally heard about it and started researching. Finding out about NPD honestly saved my life (and Dr Ramani on youtube). I just wanted to throw it out there in case you find it relates to your partner, it can really help make sense of things. And if you do find it relates, the one thing I advise you never do is tell him about it or call him out on it, especially not when you’re alone. 

You don’t deserve any of this. You are doing (more than) enough, and to be honest, with an insanely good attitude considering his treatment of you. You deserve rest just as much as him or any of us. You deserve a partner who meets you half way and who cares about/respects you and your mental/physical well-being, it sounds like it’s only you doing this. I really wish you all the best and I hope one day this doesn’t have to be your reality anymore. Hot tip OP: *He doesn't actually believe every move you make is to spite or control him.* If he was actually that irrational a person, he wouldn't be able to function outside the house. You might tolerate that, his boss, coworkers and patients would not and he woulda been fired pretty quickly if he accused everyone around him of being spiteful and controlling towards him.

But what does he get from saying that to you? He gets you on the backstep feeling you always have to justify yourself and you become avoidant of bringing up chores or topics you know will make him accuse you of it. He gets you doing exactly what he wants because you don't want to trigger him going off at you for 'spiting him' or 'trying to control him' if you suggest he does it or by trying to start a conversation about it.

He gets you so lost in your head wondering 'what am I doing wrong?' that you are unable to see the answer is **NOTHING!** His accusation isn't built on any actual grounds and it doesn't have to be, as the point isn't to express truthful feelings, it is to control you and incite his preferred reaction a.k.a. you stop trying to get him to do X, you stop talking about Y, you avoid behaviour that will make him start throwing accusations because you don't feel like having the fight. He is projecting his feelings on you: his moves are based on to spite and control you. And he thinks your job as sahm is easy...

What is the biggest reason you choose to being used  by this asshole as a maid, nanny, cleaning lady, chef etc etc? He has 1 freaking job  and expects you to have multiple and behave like a slave!??? NTA. He is gaslighting you and abusing you. Can you take the children and spend some time with your mother? I feel so bad for you and hope that you can get the help you need to resolve this. i used to be a paramedic and now am a surgeon.  I’ve worked the same hours as your husband, if not more.  I would be beyond happy to have food made for me and I would happily reheat it for myself, every single meal, every single night, all month long etc.  Your husband is acting like an entitled a**.   You’re not his mommy and he is not 2 yrs old.  Tell him to grow up and man up super stat! It's called protection.  He is spiting you and controlling you. He doesn't actually believe that. But telling you that makes him seem/feel like the victim, distracts you from your very justified anger at his unreasonable behaviour, and gets you to fall all over yourself trying to reassure him and make him feel special. While you're devoting all your energy to that, you're not spending time and energy thinking about getting away from him. When your husband is set on putting you in your place and being abusive, you CAN’T win.  NTA He's projecting. Those are all descriptions of what HE is doing. He's waking you up at odd hours to spite you and control you and he makes light of your work and sacrifices. It's like when cheaters accuse their spouse of cheating. This is textbook projection. Every move he makes is a manipulation or tool of control and he assumed that this is how everyone operated. He literally cannot conceive of someone who behaves in any other way. You can’t get through to him because you’re not operating from the same basic starting point of how human beings view relationships and motivations. 

Obviously NTA, but this is textbook abuse and abuse always always ALWAYS escalates. Realize that everything he says about you is his behavior projected on to you. This man is abusive. He is trying to control you and makes light of your contribution to the household and sacrifice your body, sleep, time, energy, *everything*. He’s projecting and it’s on him. Don’t let him convince you that it’s your problem. Leave this AH of a person. Go stay with your mom and do not return. Please for your safety and your children’s Hon, he is projecting. Because everything HE is doing is to control, spite, abd belittle you. HE is the one who keeps making light of the work you put into the family. 

You need somewhere safe to take yourself and the kids, because he is only going to get worse. Run!!! he thinks that every move I make is solely to spite him or control him

Plz see that he is projecting - he's doing this to you. You have sacrificed your health, your body, your sleep, pretty much your entire life for your husband and children. Why is that sacrifice any less than his? I'd argue that it's more. 

He's behaving like you're a personal maid, chef, cleaner, assistant, servant, and nanny. 

NTA. He's using that attack to control you. This is about the power dynamic between you. He moans about how hard he has it, belittles how much you do for the family, because it makes him to the poor, overworked under appreciated, struggling one who needs you to do everything for him, but actually it's about you doing what he wants, at any time, in any circumstance, for every need. He wants a servant, a humble, willing, obedient maid who rushes to his needs and serves him hand and foot. When you don't exhibit those abilities, when you push back at him, he is willing to STARVE himself to force you to accede to his demands. This is how far his control needs to go, to deny himself food just to manipulate you into giving in and serving him like a good little slave will. He is abusive to the max, so controlling and demanding and abusive that he defies further description. And what about YOUR contributions? Does he EVER give you positive reinforcement? Or does he think his part is way more important and undervalue you as the primary caregiver of his children. He is being downright abusive by waking up the whole damn house because…and this is still appalling me…you rightfully told him to reheat his meal. He is abusing you. Full stop. Take those precious babies and run. OP YOU ARE IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP!!!! Please protect yourself and your babies❤️ There's a book I post about all the time because it changed my life. It's called Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. Please check it out. ""...he thinks that every move I make is solely to spite him or control him..."" My ex-husband had this same attitude. His behavior is extremely controlling and spiteful yet these are the accusations he throws at you. This is a typical emotional abuse tactic. Please get you both into therapy at the very least! Leave at best case scenario. This is the dynamic he is teaching your children. Your good behaviour is not going to solve the problem because your bad behaviour is not the problem. 

Please seek subreddit s about abusive partners like ""narcissisticabuse"" You don't want your kids growing up watching him treat you like this. They will think this dynamic is normal and healthy. I know you don't want that. They might be traumatized by yelling, even one instance of it they will remember, especially the older one. And it will affect them. 

You need to get out.

I was in a similar situation and it took a lot to leave, it was only when he finally physically attacked me *in front of our 8month old* did I call the cops and they kicked *him* out. They issued a no-contact order and he had to legally stay somewhere else. I moved out with the help of social assistance and social workers. Police victim services were a great help too. 

I got my own place in social housing and relied on welfare for a bit before I went back to school. I was a suddenly single mom with literally nothing, but I could finally be free of all the stress my marriage had caused me. I could start to heal. 

I want the same for you. You need to be safe from him and his abuse, and it means taking a big step and planning your escape. Plan out the details, contact social workers at your local women's shelter and they will help you make an exit plan for you and your kids. 

Yeah, it was a lot of work to leave and suddenly find ways to support myself and my child. But it is so worth it. He thinks every move you make is to spite and control him because he’s projecting. Every move HE makes is to spite and control you. I hope your mom doesn’t know how bad it is and is okay with you living your life like that, I can’t imagine being okay with my own daughter being treated so horribly. I hope you and your kids make it out okay

Edit to clarify: projecting means he thinks you’re doing that to him because he KNOWS he’s doing it to you and he thinks that’s how people work. It’s not. This man is abusive and he's trying to make you second guess yourself. Is this what you want for your kids? Abusers often talk like that to keep the person they are abusing off balance and feeling like they cannot trust themselves or their own interpretation of events. its bc thats exactly what hes doing to you so he thinks that youre doing it back Oh honey. He doesn't think any of those things. They are accurate descriptions of how he's treating you. This is an abuser tactic - they tell you you're treating them exactly how they're treating you. Then you're so confused by the situation and the meaning of those words that you do not recognize their escalating abuse. He resents you staying home while he works, I know he may not say that but its clear, it sounds like he is too far gone to even have a sensible discussion with. NTA.

I would consider if you want to even try and make this work if he will starve himself rather than reheat a meal you made for him an call you petty. SAHMs work. Hard. Ah, but we only have HIS WORD FOR IT that he went to bed hungry 🧐 And he called HER petty. 🤦.

I was with a man like this.  Leaving was such a relief. 

I hope OP leaves him (safely).

The fog will clear after she has been away for a while, and she will see things for what they really were. 

He is abusive and controlling and contemptuous. There's a lot of us who were raised by abusive parents, so we don't see red flags; a lot who brush it off because we think we're in love; and a lot of us who lie to ourselves that it will get better... also, many people in abusive relationships feel trapped financially and isolated socially. It took me years to see. My ribs had been dislocated, there was a punch hole in the wall, and he put monitoring apps on my phone; but I didn't think it was that bad until he cheated. It doesn’t make you depressed that so many men are stuck in the 50’s? It's pure control.  He believes he owns her. ^ ^ ^ this, I am the child of parents like OP & her husband and both me and my mum suffered from the abuse of a controlling narcissist for 25 years before she left him and I'm still emotionally and mentally scared to this day, we both still have so much ptsd and trauma from it but she stayed with him for so long because he ""never hit her"" so she didn't think it was abuse. Please OP FOR THE SAKE OF YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILDREN GET OUT NOW!!! Ugh. Ten years into my first marriage I was extremely unhappy and wanted to leave him. My own mother, who's super religious, told me ""if he's not beating you then divorce is not an option"". I stayed another eight miserable years before finally getting out.

Now I'm married to a man who treats me properly. The difference is unreal. My heart breaks for my younger self for all the years I wasted on a jerk. ^^^ everything she just said.  If you’re ready to see dozens and dozens of heartbreaking stories, just Google the phrase “at least he doesn’t hit me”. Exactly. So sick of these assholes who think that because their partner stays at home and cares for their children, they should also do every little thing for their spouse after wrangling kids all day. They are a STAHP, not stay at home servant. I’m surprised this jerk doesn’t scream for his wife to come lift the toilet seat for him. This is insulting to 6 year olds. When my son was 4, I taught him to make eggs on the stove. By 5 he was doing it himself My dad legit had my mom do this but he also abused her for 30yrs. And he wonders why after the divorce he has NC and restraining order with all 3 kids and ex wife I'm sure 6-year-olds can pour themselves a bowl of cereal or make themselves some toast. say that to divorce court, please, i double dare you 🥴 homemaking IS a job, one where sadly many people aren’t getting paid for and AH like you justify it 🤮 >since she to lazy to work

Seems like you're **too** lazy to spell properly. Divorce court feels pretty strongly that you are incorrect. Absolutely agree. A friend of mine is a paramedic and he would never act this way. She's currently at home on MAT leave with their child and he still comes home and cooks or meal preps just so his wife can get some rest. 

OP, you're NTA. You're husband sucks and is definitely abusive. You need to figure this out ASAP cause it's only going to get worse. What disgusting behavior. My brother is a firefighter.  He works *24 hour* shifts. Know what he does when he gets home? He makes his family breakfast. Because he misses them. My buddy literally watched YouTube videos to find the quietest microwave buttons because his wife has ears like a hawk and he works weird hours and doesn't want to wake her My brother is a paramedic and his wife is an ER NURSE and they both run the household EQUALLY. This guy is a fucking clown. NTA op. Get the hell out. My husband is a truck driver, he often does a 16 hour day. Aside from taking the energy drinks I buy for myself, he fends for himself when he works late. >Hi, my spouse is a paramedic that works 12 hours a day and still makes his own food before he goes in and after he gets out, especially since he works nights. 
>
>This is atrocious.
>
>Your husband sucks, and this is not going to end well.

You know what's open after work? McDonald's. If her husband hates cooking, he can't get a cheeseburger and bother/harrass nobody in the process. I couldn’t agree more - OP’s husband is ridiculous! My husband and I are both paramedics working 12 hour shifts (often with overtime) so I’ve been on both sides of this scenario. Trust me, that lazy AH can definitely reheat a meal himself, even after the craziest of busy shifts. 

I’m currently on mat leave and most of the time my husband still makes dinner after a shift while I put the baby to bed. Being home with kids is work too! It wouldn’t even cross his mind to yell in the house when baby and I are asleep. If we’re asleep when he gets home he creeps around like cat burglar, in near darkness, letting the dog out and getting himself some food. 

OP NTA. Your husband’s behaviour is appalling. Especially if she's nice enough to be making dinner that all you have to do is reheat. That's a lot of effort and is sweet as can be! I've worked hours like that, and having good meals ready to just be microwaved would be heaven. Everyone in here is right, this has nothing to do with food and OP is in a dangerous situation that she needs to get out of yesterday! what would his crew do if he treated you like this and they found out? I'm getting an ""older man marries younger woman because she's easier to control"" vibe from this post. It sounds like OP's husband wants someone to have his children, raise them, take care of the household, and cater to his every need, instead of an actual partner. Every grown man should be able to feed themselves. Does he ask you to wipe his ass too? Agreed, OP. My partner is a first responder who works crazy hours, and we run our household as a team. If dinner isn't made because we're both busy with work and parenting, guess what? He cooks himself a meal or orders take out because he's a capable, grown-ass adult who doesn't need a second mommy. We do what we can to make each other's lives easier because life is stressful enough as it is.

Also, just a gentle reminder - being a stay at home parent means you're working 24/7 without pay. 

You've already worked out a great compromise by meal prepping, which requires a lot of effort and thoughtfulness on your part. Your husband sounds like an entitled, controlling brat. Please do not allow your spouse to abuse you. If this dynamic continues, you both will be teaching your children that this is acceptable behaviour. Oof. I just realized mom helping might be why he’s forcing a power play. NTA op, get out. I’ve been there and it only gets worse, even when it doesn’t seem like it can. All the OP has to do is point to the dish in the fridge. Hell be hungry enough to eat it sooner or later. Then he'll have to figure out how to press the 1 button on their microwave Seconding this advice. Abuse is not a ""we"" problem. This. And no therapist should take this couple as a client Second. I read this and was waiting for the pet where he hit her. Maybe didn’t happen this time, but just wait. (Not that the emotional abuse he did do isn’t disgusting as well but this post left me worried for her physical safety) Hooooooly shit I would be beyond grateful to come home and have a a clean home and a whole meal ready that I can just throw in the microwave!!! Yes! Op your husband gets to come home from work and relax. He gets to have weekends to do what he wants. When do YOU get to have a break? When do YOU get to go do what you want?

You are working MORE than he is right now with a newborn and a toddler who need you 24/7 and your husband still treats you as a personal bangmaid. This is not okay. He is being controlling and abusive.

I am in the camp of leave his ass and let him fend for himself - you'll be doing less work with no longer having to cater to him. I was scrolling to find this. Do not engage in couples counseling with this person, this is abusive (or at least borderline abusive) and it is generally not a good idea to talk to a therapist as a couple. OP, this person here is right. Get a therapist only for yourself. To navigate this situation you need professional help. This whole relationship dynamic is extremely toxic. >This is abusive behavior and it is a bad idea to do couples counseling in an abusive relationship.

Can I ask why? Isn't that exactly how you'd approach this if you wanted to make it work for the kids? Oh my god, me too. You are so right.

NTA, OP. This is abusive and not okay at all. Please seek help.

>he expects dinner or lunch ready whenever he gets home, whether I'm sleeping or busy with the kids. It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works.

Honey, this is not okay. He's expecting you to sideline your own wellbeing *and your kids'* to do something that he can very well do on his own. Waking you up mid-sleep because he, a grown man, wants to have food made for him? 🚩🚩🚩🚩

>Well, at 11pm last night, he comes home while I'm sleeping after putting the baby to sleep. I wake up to him shouting for me from the living room.

Shouting and waking up sleeping wife & kids at 11 pm is an extremely immature and angry response, with no consideration for you or your kids.

But more than that - it's a power play. The practical step for a hungry person to do would be go heat up readily available meals, not shout at their spouse. He can do it, he knows that. He wants you serving him and sacrificing everything for him. This isn't about him being able to eat or having food, this is about he getting want he wants - control over you.

>He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself, when I'm here and I can do it.

There's SO MANY things wrong with this comment.

1. Reheating *premade dinners* is not a chore, it's fending for yourself. He doesn't do anyone any favors by feeding his own ass. He knows that.
2. You're not ridiculous for expecting him, a grown man, to feed himself. You just took care of your kids and did every chore in the house for an entire day. That's work, and a lot of it. Your job as a SAHM is no less valid than his.
3. Your purpose in life is NOT to do everything for him. He's treating you like a slave.

>He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point.  
>  
>He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out.

*You didn't make him anything.* You prepped everything, and the only thing he needed to do was reheat food, which is very much something he can do. He made the choice to not do that, and you can do nothing about it. He's the one who's being petty and starved himself to prove a point.

*You are not responsible for this.* It's abundantly clear he CHOSE, on his own, to go to bed hungry. He wasn't incapable of reheating food, he just didn't like how you didn't bend over to serve him. Notice how all of these are things he has 100% control over and decided for himself? Yeah, you have nothing to do with this.

Him blaming you for something he did (starving him) is a kind of gaslighting. Same. I lived that life with a colicky newborn, ppd, and my SO expecting me to cater to his every whim that he was fully capable of handling himself. Being woken up to him yelling at 3am bc the kitchen was dirty, his laundry that he just took off wasn’t being started and he was hungry. My best advice is leave, it doesn’t get better. I refuse to ever cater or be abused by other man. Reading this made me relive all my feelings from then. I feel the same way.  It's funny how trauma never leaves us.

I think OP's husband feels entitled because he views her as relaxing at home with the kids while he slaved to provide for them.  Huge red flag. I've once read a different post where an OP (NOT OUR OP) got a broom as a gift and she left. Her husband thinks she was just greedy, even after he made jokes about her being a SAHM and expecting her to wake at 5 am and make dinner and clean the bathroom after him.

It can get so much worse. OP, if you see this, TAKE ACTIONS!!! Same. Reading the comment that you replied to felt like a nightmare in some way. I'm usually fine with horror and stuff but I almost decided to not finish reading the comment. 🤗🤗🤗🤗 People really underestimate how stressful it is living your life walking on eggshells. You don’t ever actually fully fall asleep when, in the back of your mind, you know that you risk being woken up by an angry screaming man. It’s *scary*, it’s stressful, and it’s SAD! No one goes into a relationship thinking that’s how their life is going to go! No one thinks the person they love is someday going to *not let them fucking sleep* like sleep deprivation is literal torture. Yes!!!! Reminds me of decades ago when I had a newborn and my ex H came home from his night shift in the early morning. I had cooked a meal earlier, plated all ready to heat up, a beer mug chilling in the freezer. I was juggling the baby while preparing his meal, setting up the tv tray. I brought him his meal, returned with the filled Beer Mug while holding the Baby. The baby was fussy,crying,so when I poured the beer it made a big foam on top. He got upset and said that he didn't want a mug of foam,so he threw the contents at me,hitting the baby in the face,which sent the infant into a panic of crying and gasping. He then yelled at me for being a bad mother because I couldn't quite the baby and then tossed the meal in the garbage and left.  
I can assure you it doesn't get better,because that was the tip of the iceberg Holy shiiiiiit. You too? I felt the same way. It was just like a cold, heavy weight just landed on my shoulders.

My ex used to pull this when he was working nights. Mostly because he, ""worked a little later"" than I did. I was done at 3.30am, but I was an hour and a bit drive from home, and I'd be absolutely wiped by the time I got home.

He was less than a fifteen minute drive, and he'd wake me up to either get me to cook with him because he hated what I cooked, or make me eat what he'd cooked so he could criticize me for something I'd fucked up on.

Exes stay exes.

Edit; NTA OP. Also, I'm kinda curious as to what he did before he met you. This right here.  I've been in therapy more times than I care to count, and have diagnosed Complex PTSD - and the behavior described by OP was nearly enough to send me into a nasty spiral from my own past traumas that were similar abusive situations.

Gah... think I need to just log off and go play with my cats for a couple hours while the nightmare settles itself down a bit Same, visceral memory of hunkering down in bed while my father shouts abuse at my mother. I heard it through the heating vents, through the walls, and my stomach hurts. I went to visit friends for a week out of state when I was still with my ex-husband. I was telling him of all this yummy food we were eating and he shoots back “how dare you tell me about food while I’m practically starving when you’re not here for me” 

Oh ok buddy, can’t microwave a single meal? Sorry I’m not your mom Your husband is like a midievil  asshole. This relationship is non sustainable as is. Get professional counseling. He is not a good father figure/ role model for your children to follow. They must never be brought up to think that his treatment of you is normal or okay. Just chiming into say, having been a SAHM with two young kids, your days aren’t really your own.  Your schedule is dictated by the whims of your children.  Yes, you can set mealtimes and downtimes, and schedule activities, but they can be derailed in an instant by an illness, or teething, or potty training setbacks, or just straight up tantrums and toddler destruction.  Yes, OP’s husband is on call, but I guarantee he has the luxury of downtime at his job, and a lot more than OP gets.  NTA. I just registered that he is the driver, not the paramedic in the back of the bus. Dude. It sounds like he's got like a savior's complex or something and thinks he's SO important that he deserves to be idolized and doted on by OP. It's disgusting and not normal. Depending on her skills and education level, day care for two kids could easily be far more than she would make working. Sad, but true. OMG thank you so much!! Made my day!

**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.** You don’t yell at and berate your spouse because you’re “used to” having meals prepared at any ridiculous hour. No normal person would do that. He's abusive, he doesn't deserve the title of EMT or Paramedic. Right?! When my daughter was little, dad getting home from work was the best part of the day. I got a little break, he was excited to see his baby girl, sometimes I had dinner ready sometimes I didn’t. Either one was fine. 

OP, ask yourself if life is better with him around, or more stressful. Do you look forward to it? Or dread it? You know what the answers mean. A partner should enrich your life, it’s a team and two should be better then one. Yeah but this asshole would probably love being fed and then expect it going forward FYI, (deliberate) sleep deprivation is considered torture under the Geneva Convention. I think he's more concerned about the power dynamics here, that you aren't ""serving"" him. Reheating a dinner is hardly a chore. Girl, this is just gonna get worse from here. You need to run and fast. omg if this guy considers putting a plate of cooked food in the microwave and pressing ""1"" for an auto cook setting a ""chore"" ..... what in the world does he help you with without complaining? this is not too much for anyone to do for themselves. How is heating up food you're about to eat a chore? It's literally one step more than actually eating the food. Does he cry about having to do a chore if you don't cut up his steak for him? Do you have to load up a fork and bring it to his mouth, or does he need you to chew the food too and spit it into his mouth like a baby bird?

**Edit:** I'm not trying to be snippy with you OP, it's your ""partner"" I'm fuming at. I think you should go stay with your mom for a while. Withdraw some money, pack bags and take all your premade meals with you. Tell him you're not coming home until you talk about his abusive behavior and he agrees to individual therapy and anger management. Please don’t let him convince you that you are petty.  What you are trying to implement is self care.  He sounds like a scary person and I’m worried for you. How do you think he'll respond if you stop cooking for him? Several of us are concerned for your well-being, my dear. If you will be on the receiving end of more verbal or other abuse for doing this, then the best choice is to leave, and take your kids and yourself somewhere safe. Is that an option? It’s not that much work to get something out of the fridge then push a few buttons on the microwave. Your husband is just being an unreasonable asshole and feeling entitled because he works. Does he help with the kids or the household chores? I think you should stop cooking for him. He obviously doesn’t appreciate it. And being a SAHM means you work and do chores 24/7. An adult feeding themselves is hardly a chore. You both work full time jobs during the day! A SAHM is a full time job.
He does need to do chores! 
Cook dinner, because you need to rest anyway, but don't put up with the abuse.

Sleep deprivation is a common abuse tactic by the way!

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/relationships/ >he thinks I'm imposing unfair dynamics having him work then do chores

Chucking a plate of food in the microwave isn't ""doing chores"". What the hell.

OP, your husband is abusive and your post has got me worried. His insane expectations have resulted in both you and your kids not getting adequate sleep, and I would be very surprised if this is the only situation where he treats you like shit.

Do you have access to your own money? Are you in contact with your family? I don't want to scare you but your husband's behaviour is frightening and I think at the *very* least you need to have an escape plan in place. He feels entitled to make you sleep deprived. That’s abuse. 

You don’t know when he’s coming home and it’s unsafe to leave food out on the counter for hours. He would blame you if he got food poisoning. Ergo The only way to make him happy is for you to be sleep deprived. 

This is physical abuse. Feeding yourself isnt a chore, it’s a basic adult function. Cooking meals is a chore, taking a pre-made meal, and sticking it in the microwave **is not** a chore Feeding yourself is not a fucking chore. Making dinner for everyone then cleaning up after it is a chore. Reheating dinner someone made for you is not. If your SO is normally like this you need to seriously consider your options. 

Do you have equal access to the money he earns? What about transportation? The reeks of controlling behavior to me, so you don’t have to respond just think about it. Controlling sleep is definitely an abusive behavior. My parents had me do chores for my allowance as a kid. If I tried to convince them that reheating my OWN dinner was a chore, they would’ve laughed in my face. That’s like saying taking a shower is a chore. It’s doing the bare minimum for yourself as a human Hey OP, while many people are pointing out the obvious -that reheating a plate of food isn't a chore- I just want to point out to you that **working does not mean he has to do zero chores**. Ma'am, you need to run. If not for you, then for the well-being of your children. There's a reason why sleep deprivation is a form of torture. Randomly disrupting your sleep by screaming is borderline abusive. Not only that, but he is also gaslighting you. Be sure that when your children grow up, this will be their ""normal"". Reheating is not a chore, it’s a step you take in feeding yourself which is a necessity. If he was single he’d either be reheating microwave meals himself or going through the drive through for food, wasting money and eating unhealthy. 

He’s ridiculous, controlling and abusive. After reading the other comments, I think everyone else is right he's concerned about power dynamics.  

It's like how I once read here on Reddit about a couple arguing about cheese, and the girlfriend said her therapist said it's not about the cheese.  

Honestly, you should be thinking about your options. putting food in the microwave is not a chore, it takes all of 30 seconds Working full time doesn’t get you out of doing chores. If he’s so concerned about what HE does, ask him for the $185,000/year SAHMs are considered to be worth. My husband did the exact opposite of yours....our oldest child was just turned 1 when our last child was born, my husband worked full time and spent the weekends cooking and storing lunches and dinners for the week days so I didn't have to stress about feeding myself or my toddler on top of the newborn. He came home from work, took both kids off my hands and sent me for a shower/bath every night so I had some me time. He got up just as often as I did during the night even through he was up for work at 6am every morning. Your husband sounds like a selfish, abusive asshole and he's only going to get worse. You can try therapy but I suggest being realistic and preparing to split from him too. Get all yours and your kids documents, medical, birth certificates etc in a safe place. I hope things can change for you both, good luck. Reheating his dinner is not a chore. Wait until he sees all of the chores he has to do when you divorce him. No no no. Please don’t. He is abusive and saying that could knock him off whatever sliver of control he has. This is not about his food. This is about him controlling you and making you his slave. It’s abuse and you need to GET OUT! Get the hell out of there while he is at work. You and the kids are not in a safe situation. Please take all this advice to leave him, or go to your mother’s, or to insist on counseling for what it really is—the voice of experience. These women have been where you are now and can recognize what’s happening instantly. That can be really hard to do when you have PPD, extreme fatigue and a history of doing whatever your husband demands because it’s easier than having a big fight. Sometimes the big fight is all that’s left. I’m so sorry you are going through this—cling right to your mother, friends and anyone else who can guide you. He thinks less of you because you are a stay at home mom. He doesn’t consider raising children and doing what sounds like all the chores to be “working”. 

Put your foot down. He needs to grow up and do his fair share. Making food after work or throwing something into the microwave isn’t an unreasonable expectation. Lots of people work a lot of hours and then come home to cook or do chores. No reason he can’t. Please be careful dealing with a person this out there, I know you might not think he would hurt you, but the level of control he's expecting over your life is very disturbing You currently work 24/7 caring for the children and do 100% of the chores. Being a SAHM is work. If you were not doing that work he would be paying for childcare. You do contribute financially through cost avoidance. He is belittling your work and you. The man purposely wakes you up from sleep to serve him. Nothing about that is okay. Let him starve. I work full time and I can still cook my own meals. I'd be over the moon if all I had to do was reheat dinner in the microwave every night. It's pathetic. Take your children and your important documents and go stay with your mother. You're working too.  You're not even getting paid for it.  Where's your break? Where's your servant to bring you food after you've minded the house and children all day? It's not a chore to reheat and feed yourself food, that's simple shit a child would do for himself, like I did as a kid. Zapping something in the microwave takes 2 minutes tops. You work longer hours in a more difficult role than he does. You are not allowed 'time off' by this man and as an EMS dispatcher among many other roles - I am telling you, you're husband is not being worked to death as the driver of the truck. 

He is working you to death and inflating his workload to justify it. Period. You need to do more than that. You need to demand couples therapy or just outright divorce him. This is more than just food. 

When I started couples therapy with my husband, it opened my eyes to how abusive he was being. It was very obvious before therapy but for some reason I was blind to it. It's not pettiness to demand respect from your partner. Please listen to the top comments, OP. You deserve better than this, whether that means just standing up for yourself, or therapy, or a divorce. You. Deserve. Better.

NTA you’re a great mother and a great wife for going out of your way to prepare your husbands meals beforehand which is why i’m so deeply frustrated that he doesn’t appreciate nor understand how difficult it is for you to take on all these responsibilities at home without his help. you deserve better OP NTA. I think it’s time you inflicted some weaponized incompetence on him. Do everything horribly and ask him if he could do better. In what world is putting a container of your own food in the microwave and pressing a button a “chore”?

Does he also tell you to bring him a glass of water because it’s a “chore” to get one ? Does he wake you up to come change the channel in the tv because pushing a button on a remote is a “chore”? You might need to get back into the workforce.   One day, you may want a divorce and be stuck because he has all the power.   Has he always been a brute? Reheating food you made for him isn't a chore. He's an incompetent. 

Don't cook for him ever again imo. Go on strike. He woke you up to be petty. Strike. Move out. Get child support and alimony. Move on. NTA huge red flags… if he doesn’t pull it together and start respecting you this relationship probably is not the one for you. NTA. And go ahead and go on strike. You guys also need counseling. But if he doesn't learn his lesson/doesn't agree to couple's counseling, it might be a red flag. Control issues have the potential to escalate. 

Consider this a fork in the road and indication of where your relationship could head. He should still be doing chores, when he's home he should do 50% of the chores during that time! Adults do chores!

But in all honesty tread carefully. Don't provoke yelling in front of or within earshot of your kids. 

Plan an escape for you and your kids, and do it quickly. It can and probably will get worse. It is NOT petty. If he can’t be respectful then he can do it himself. 

He’s not incapable so don’t let him act as though he is. 

Being a SAHM doesn’t mean you do everything and he does nothing. It’s a job just like anything else. You are responsible for it all when he’s not there. When he’s home, chores and childcare are to be split evenly. Anything less than that and he’s not being an actual partner. 

Interrupting your sleep for something this stupid is rude af. 

Seriously…why are you still with him? He’s shown you over and over again that he’s controlling, rude, and disrespectful. Is this the life you want for yourself? Is this what you want your children thinking a good healthy relationship is? I'd also stop doing his laundry and cleaning his home spaces to let him see how much you do at home. You could even take the kids to your folks or a friend and simply stop doing chores at home.

Tell him you will resume once he apologies AND cleans the house AND makes his meals of a day. After that he'll be more than grateful for what you do. If he becomes abusive after that, run. As others have said it's not about his perception of splitting and sharing tasks. It's about control and that's a no for any healthy relationship.

NTA and please get a support system with friends and family because I fear for your safety. He clearly doesn't view SAHM work as ""real"" work, so, that's another fun layer for this shit onion. Putting something in the microwave and pressing a button is not a chore. Don't let him or yourself think it is. That's absurd.  Meal prepping for your family is a chore, operating a microwave to heat food for one person is not. You should do it.  It would be worth his divorcing you because then you wont have to deal with his demands.  It would be worth raising your children alone so you wont have to deal with his bs And lets not forget him shouting in a house with small kids. He just wants her to not be able to sleep. Girl, same.  I even lost use of my right arm for 8 months and shit still got done. lmfao a reddit warrior recommending a therapist and divorce 🤣 classic Yep. Men like this go from one tit to the next. He’s almost definitely competent enough, but if he behaved like a reasonable person, his control and manipulation wouldn’t be nearly so effective. ""He's never hit me"".  Every person that's been physically abused could say that at some point. It doesn't mean it won't happen. I hope she can get out safely, and it's scary for the kids, too. EMT =/= paramedic. They get mad for the same reason a doctor does when someone calls them 'nurse'. These are different levels of expertise, ability, scope of practice and education. And yeah, most BLS (Basic Life Support) / EMT ambulance drivers do casually call themselves the driver when referring to their role as they are support for the ALS (Advanced Life Support), paramedic, etc. crew members in a pinch but will usually be driving the truck while the other is in the back with the patient.

>The biggest difference between EMTs and Paramedics is the amount of education they receive and the level of care they provide  for patients (i.e. scope of practice). 

>**Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) students complete a course that is a minimum of 170 hours in length.** EMTs are educated in assessing a patient and determining if any life threatening injuries or illnesses may be present.  This includes splinting injuries for a patient following a motor vehicle collision, administering life saving epinephrine for a patient suffering an allergic reaction, or even administering CPR to a patient in cardiac arrest. Other skills the EMT will learn include oxygen administration, bag valve mask ventilations, delivery of a newborn, and even administration of several medications.   An EMT’s assessment skills, the ability to quickly recognize if someone is dying, is the best tool in their tool box and the primary focus of the EMT education. 

>In general, to be eligible for enrollment into an EMT course you do not need to have any previous medical experience. The eligibility requirements and prerequisites for EMT and paramedic courses may vary from school to school. Be sure to check with the school’s and your state’s regulations before you enroll for a course. For example, in California you must be at least 18 years of age to be eligible to certify as an EMT. 

>**Paramedic (PM) students complete a program between 1,200 to 1,800 hours and may last six to twelve months.** Topics covered in paramedic courses include anatomy and physiology, cardiology, medications, and medical procedures. Paramedic courses build on EMT education and teach skills such as administering medications, starting intravenous lines, providing advanced airway management, EKG Interpretation for patients, and learning to provide emergency care to patients with  life-threatening medical or traumatic emergencies.  Caring for the victims of a motor vehicle crash, interpreting the EKG of a heart attack patient, or delivering a baby; these are all patients a paramedic must be prepared to assist during their shift.  It never gets boring!  Through a combination of lectures, skills labs, followed by hospital internship, then EMS field internship, students are prepared to pass the national certification exams to achieve the highest certification level of pre-hospital care provider in the United States.

>To be eligible for a paramedic course you must be an EMT and generally have at least 6 months of work experience as an EMT. Paramedic Programs may have different admission requirements.  Some require you to take college level Anatomy and Physiology prior to admission, many have personal health requirements such as proof of immunizations and a physical as an admission requirement.  Schools may also require a criminal background check, admissions interview, or an entrance exam to determine your eligibility for admission.  Each school has slightly different requirements but the goal is to select those candidates who will be successful in the training program. I’m just a basic, so I do be driving a lot, it’s a joke term to a lot of people. I said this above as well. That part rings false for me I'm required to eat a renal diet so I'm very limited in what I can eat. I have to watch sodium, potassium and phosphorus. Their [renal menu](https://www.momsmeals.com/webres/File/WaiverMenus/7925%20Renal%20Menu.pdf) is really good and I think there are very few services that cater to that. You can pick and choose the meals you want too. They have other meals that are more than just that. I think [compared to other meal services](https://www.moneyunder30.com/meal-delivery-comparison), the price isn't bad.  

You're kind of paying for a convenience factor as well. Like if you check Instacart vs the actual grocery store, you'll see the grocery store has lower prices. Same with UberEats and DoorDash vs restaurant carryout. Because you're not actually buying from the grocery store. You're buying from Instacart and the grocery store is their supplier. If you want the lower prices, you have to be prepared to spend the time and gas going to the store and buying the food yourself vs ordering from Instacart. In other words, you're not just paying for the food. You're paying for time. True, on both the age and abuse. I changed it haha Ah sorry I misread!

Happy cake day! He refuses to let OP sleep (which is a form of abuse), screaming at 11pm when the kids are asleep.

He works 12 hours with days off, she's working 24 hours with no breaks.

If he doesn't want to reheat food then he can learn to cook his own meals I agree. I'm on team 'wait till he's out and then leave with the kids to her mom's place.' Yes, I fear this man is likely to get violent. Before you do this OP you can call the police and ask for them to assist you with a “close out” to help you get your things and kids out of the house under supervision if it goes badly. Agreed. That nice little script offered above will likely result in OP's abusive husband becoming very angry and perhaps physically violent. He's not going to have a come-to-Jesus moment and thank her for making him a better man. He's going to freak out. Amen. This little speech sounds nice but feels childishly naive. Then she leaves him A meaningful developmental or behavioral issue still isn't a free pass to be abusive This was written by someone that doesn't understand emotional immaturity and narcissism. This dude is dangerous. Yes. Yes it is. It makes me feel sick that this is something to worry about. Like ""say the wrong words and your abusive husband may murder you."" I think you're right, unfortunately, but seriously, wtf is wrong with people? So scary. He isn't going to. Ya'll don't get it. He doesn't CARE what she does around the house...to him, she's something he owns that he controls. You can't say the right words and make him a good person. He's an abuser. Waiting for the post ""AITA for feeding my husband from the wrong end after he treated me very poorly?"" 😅 > God this man is lucky he isn't married to me. If you woke me up when I had babies, you'd be eating dinner from the wrong end. 🤣

Lol you're the lucky one who's not married to a guy like that.

Stop pretending like you know what abusive people are like.

People like you who thinks you can be in control in any given situation are disgusting.

This is a potentially dangerous situation for OP and here you are thinking you're much better than OP in handling these situations. Everyone thinks that until they’re in the same situation. It’s NOT her fault. I’m actually still upset about this and I don’t know these people. someone on here said he owes an apology. An apology is the last thing he owes. He owes counseling and making therapy appointments to fix his broken ass Something tells me you have never been in an abusive relationship. There is a difference between taking care of ""your spouse's basic needs"" (which is a whole other thing, because, I mean, people should be able to fend on their own regardless) and being treated like a slave. I up voted it on your behalf. Everyone is seeming to be against the marriage/husband without thinking about what the actual cause of that much stress actually is. I know how I react when I'm overly stressed out versus when I'm in a clear mind. This guy seems at his last little bit before a mental snap if a microwave is gonna set him off. Why am I not surprised that your dad was a cop Those sure are some numbers If you are going to pretend to be a hacker at least realize you posted an invalid IP address. 

Needs to have four octets with a maximum of 255 per octet. Interesting. That job doesn't exists in my country. If you're on an ambulance, you're certified to provide medical care, hence why we don't like being referred to as ""ambulance drivers"" because while that is part of the job, that takes away the essence of what the job truly is. Most consider it offensive. >Maybe an ESH if she had been awake.

No, op wouldn't suck in any way for refusing to do something that anyone with a functioning pair of hands could easily do on their own.

**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.** DARVO, 100%. Holy crap. That line “He refuses to believe that someone would have good motives …” just hit me *hard*. ^^^ u/throwawaySarah7 PLEASE start reading this when you have a few spare minutes! [Here is a link to a free PDF of this book.](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf) Good grief. I'm so glad that AH is far behind you now. You sound like an amazingly strong woman! Your new husband is so lucky to have you Thank you for sharing this. You are so strong. I desperately hope OP reads this. Thank you Grandma, you were so strong for leaving then it really warms my heart when I hear of women from your generation (the good times when nobody got divorced because everyone was happy and loved each other) who have the courage to leave and make a new life for themselves. I pray there will be more happiness and blessings in your life Thank you so much for sharing your experience to help this young lady. ❤ Hear hear. I’m a working mom because it’s *easier*. OP needs to read “gift of fear” or “why does he do that” and make moves to protect herself ASAP. That’s a really valid and valuable perspective. Thank you for sharing and I’m sorry you’ve gone through this. I’m glad you’re on the other side now. It’s this saying ‘when you’re wearing rose tinted glasses, red flags are just flags’. It is true that if abusive behaviour is normalised as far as childhood and upbringing, it becomes almost a default. Thanks for making me check my privilege. Both equally depressing really. >It doesn’t make you depressed that so many men are stuck in the 50’s?

I find the acceptance more disturbing. These dudes have no reason to change or reflect on their outlook, because women will cater to them.

So it sucks, IMO, that so many individuals feel that they deserve so little in return for the love they give. Am also the child of parents like this. My dad always demanded dinner be on the table at 4pm… not 3:59, not 4:01. Life gets hard and this isn’t always possible, abusers do not understand this. 
OP this is only the beginning. It starts like this and ends with abuse, torture, intimidation and violence towards you and/ or your children. Men like this do not change. They may change their tactics, but their desire to control and manipulate will never change. 
Please seek out support within your community to leave this situation before things escalate. Praying for the safety of you and your children. Yup. My friend who is an EMT packs a ridiculous amount of food to have during her shift because she may or may not get regular breaks, whatever, and cannot properly care for emergency patients if she's not properly nourished - and yes, it is hard and hungry work - so she makes sure she has food to eat. 


If he's so weak from hunger that he nearly passes out from the effort of [checks notes] opening a Tupperware container, he's not doing a good job as an EMT, either. My husband is a correctional officer and works 12-16 hours a day, frequently 24hrs. If I'm asleep you know what he does? He gets his own damn food. He makes his own breakfast and takes care of getting lunch at work if I haven't gotten to it. 

This is garbage behavior. What's to stop him from getting in her face yelling, to cornering her, to pushing her, to hitting her?

This gets worse. 
It always gets worse. One of my really good friends is a paramedic, and same. His wife just had their second child and he actually acts as a parent and a partner when he’s not working. What an awesome and loving guy! Yup, my husband is a Paramedic and works 24 hour shifts as well. He takes a bunch of food with him for meals and snacks and when I pick him up in the morning he either makes his own breakfast or we do it together. This is the stuff I love to read That is so wholesome. Your buddy is adorable. That's so caring that he did that! I wish microwaves were quieter in general. I hate how much noise they make, everything from the opening and closing of the door, the buttons, and the beeping that for some reason CANNOT BE TURNED OFF, it's just so annoying for light sleepers or people with sensory problems. That is just super sweet! So... What was the quietest microwave? I need it please There are microwaves where you can turn off the beeps entirely!! This gets the awwwww out loud award! That's a good partner to do life with. I just got a Samsung. It has silent mode! It’s amazing! Damn well maybe you could cook him a meal sometime😊 Yuppppp. If he's going to ""die of starvation"" or whatever he can stop at a drive though on the way home or I dunno pack himself a lunch?? Medics typically still get lunch breaks No, OP’s husband is an A H. And abusive to boot. 

My SO is also a paramedic, and there’s a fairly large age gap between us (approx 10 years). Even though he’s fairly old school, he still finds time to help out, including cooking dinner and cleaning up after himself. He’s an adult, and he acts like it. 

OP’s husband acts like a wailing, selfish child. 

Oh, and NTA OP Would be grateful and giving gifts of appreciation to whomever made it happen!!! You and I, this would be srly awesome. Right?  That’s living the dream! Because you can't use therapy to make an abuser change. They're not acting in good faith - he makes deliberate choices to hurt his wife and doesn't WANT to stop. Abusers tend to control the narrative in therapy and turn the situation around on their victims, or, use the info they get in sessions to further hurt them. Being honest with an abuser can escalate the abuse at home. No therapist should be accepting a couple with this kind of issues as patients, it's dangerous. 

There's a great book called ""Why does he do that?"" By Lundy Bancroft I highly recommend. He was a therapist for abusive guys and shows over and over again they're not ""out of control"" or ""just mad,"" they feel entitled to hurt their loved ones (which OPs guy clearly does). It's a free download on the interwebs. Because an abuser will use couples therapy to get better at abusing their victim.  They'll take anything that they hear from their victim and find a way to twist it around to gaslight and abuse them more.  They can also learn techniques by watching the therapist & victim interact that they can use to be more manipulative of their victim. So the kids can grow up in a fearful, abusive household? That's clearly better for them than a divorce and will definitely not normalize abusive relationships for them as they start to date and choose partners. /s, all the s Not even made for him. Merely reheated. I'm guessing this requires no more effort than pressing a button on the microwave. he's waking her up for his food cos he wants to keep her unslept. it's easier to manipulate someone who can't think straight from exhaustion I used to work awful hours when I worked in an ER. 10 hour shift on Friday followed by two 16 hour shifts on Saturday and Sunday. I came home on Sunday essentially dead to the world and *still* reheated my premade dinner or grabbed fast food on the way home and went to sleep. My husband was a paramedic and worked 12s. We never ever treated each other like this. I'm sure she's not getting great sleep even when you take her husband's actions out of the equation. That is not what you want when you're taking care of two small children that cannot care for themselves.. He also wants to blame you for his choice to go to bed hungry, which has nothing to do with you — the food’s right there, he can heat it or cook himself I bet he says that when he has to take care of his children as 'babysitting'. He seems the type. Yeah. Taking care of house and kids is work. Hard work. He thinks it's nothing. If I wasn't worried for the kids I'd say let him take a sick day and take care of the kids all day to see what it's like. And don't clean beforehand.

But I wouldn't leave kids in his care. 😒 He needs to understand being a SAHP is a job too. Plus u don't get paid or have career advancement. Start thinking of a way out OP. This makes me so thankful for my boyfriend.  I work first shift and he works second.  I'm always asleep when he gets home.  If he needs something from the bedroom, he will come in super quiet and uses a flashlight so he doesn't disturb me.

OPs husband is treating her like a servant and not like a wife or partner.  I wouldn't even pre-nake his meals.  Time for him to put on his big boy pants and learn how to adult. Also, taking care of children IS WORK! When is your break, OP? It sounds like he’s not lifting a finger when he gets home so everything must fall squarely to you 24/7. The imbalance in this relationship and the disrespect and unloving way in which your husband treats you is painful to read.  

NTA. And can you imagine being those poor kids/ being woken up by dad yelling, then hearing parents argue in the middle of the night? They must have been so scared. I believe that was supposed to be “didn’t make him do anything” >Reheating premade dinners is not a chore, it's fending for yourself.

Heck, this is barely even fending for himself. He's not making anything, just pressing a button, stirring, and eating. Also. Not to knock paramedics and how exhausting responding to traumatizing situations is. But they sit in dispatch waiting for calls - not cruising around like nurse Batman .. he can heat up some damn food. Is it even fending for himself though? Like she made the food and packaged it for him. So all he has to do is reheat it which is like 2-5 minutes and most of that time, you're standing there waiting for the food to be done. Which he'd be waiting anyways, even if she were to reheat it for him, so it's not like it's done quicker.

I agree with everything you said, btw. I just kinda laughed at ""fending for himself"" because it's like the bare, bare minimum lol ITS NOT GASLIGHTING This man seems so incompetent. How can someone trust a man to save someones life, when the man isn't even able to reheat food? >But more than that - it's a power play.

It's only a power play.

Putting a prepared meal from the fridge in the microwave takes so much less effort and time than going upstairs and waking up your sleeping wife to do it for you.

This is a man who feels entitled to a wife and mother being utterly devoted to him and the thought of her not being at his beck and call 24/7 is unbearable for him... This is a man that wants a servant, not a spouse... Your comments here always hit the nail right on the head. I hope OP is okay. if it's such a chore op should ask him if he needs to be fed like the 6 month old too next time. she could puree it all up and spoon feed him since he works so hard. OP this is scary and I hope your husband grows up and learns that you are working just as hard as him taking care of the house and the kids. I’m glad you saw the light and your own worth. You and your kid deserve better! >Same. I lived that life with a colicky newborn, ppd, and my SO expecting me to cater to his every whim that he was fully capable of handling himself. Being woken up to him yelling at 3am bc the kitchen was dirty, his laundry that he just took off wasn’t being started and he was hungry. My best advice is leave, it doesn’t get better. I refuse to ever cater or be abused by other man. Reading this made me relive all my feelings from then.

My mom, after divorcing my dad, said she was going to be single for the rest of her life because she never wanted to be controlled again. And damn it, 20 years later she's stuck to it. My dad was extremely sexist and controlling, and verbally abusive.

She's not HAPPY now, but she's free to live life as she pleases. And if he bothered to spend any time with the kids at all, he'd know there's nothing relaxing about kids. Except for when they're asleep I wonder will she even read this. I wonder if she sitting right now wondering what has been unleashed. Me too. 

We think we’re healed. We think we’ve done the work, but the trauma is still there, hidden somewhere in the body. 

It’s a weird one. cooking meals ahead of time is a chore. reheating them in the microwave is not. he might as well call wiping his own shit off his ass a chore and start waking OP up at 3am to do it for him If he thinks warming up an already-made dinner is a chore, you could just make him sandwiches.  Ready-to eat!! I’d be so grateful to come home to a plate of food after working all day or night. Popping food in the microwave? I’d be weeping with gratitude as I pressed 1. He doesn’t do anything without complaining, or just doesn’t do anything at all outside of being home a paycheck, based on what it sounds like. I think the vibe is that he doesn’t help or expect to help with..anything. No cleaning, definitely no childcare, no laundry, nothing. “It’s literally one step more than actually eating the food”

This made me audibly snort. Really drives home how petty this miserable excuse for a man is being. Seriously, this clown waited an HOUR to come pout and whine about being hungry rather than slinging the Tupperware into the microwave for three minutes. I've seen six-year-olds with better self management than this. Totally agree with this. OP, make sure you use the word “abusive”. His reaction to this word can be very telling. Someone who is in a loving relationship doesn’t want to be abusive. They’ll want to figure out what they’re doing so they can stop doing it to the person they love. If he gets defensive and angry, there’s a good chance he won’t want to change. She mentioned her moms idea in her post, sounds like a visit to grandma is in order. Maybe a permanent move. I don’t even have small kids, I work nights so home most days, and my boyfriend would be thrilled to have food ready to heat up. Hell, he’s thrilled when I cook at all.

**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.** Right?  He walked in the house at 11pm and starts screaming for dinner.  He couldn't even respect his infant and toddler enough to walk upstairs and just wake the mom... nope the whole family has to be woken up bc he is hungry. Holy shit! Good for you!!

But yeah, we make it work!!! y'all love to tell people to break up their families Absolutely . He is weaponizing his incompetence.  My point was more if he is willing to go on a hunger strike and not take care of himself, i sure as shooting wouldn’t trust him alone with those kids. That actually makes a lot of sense, my patients get Mom's Meals and I always feel bad giving them because the portions for breakfast just don't look good. They're good for people with special diets though which is understandable. I hope you have an amazing day and I loved your story. I think the kids should be staying at grandma's when that discussion takes place and have a bag packed in the car and keys in your pocket. If he escalates things you would want to be able to leave immediately. THIS. Never tell them they've lost control of you. Just gtfo. He's a ticking time bomb. I don't think it'll take much to set him off. It’s 100% the sort of feel-good speech I would come up after an argument, long after I could have used it. I understand why it’s getting upvoted, even though imo it’s bad advice It certainly is naive. Totally agree I feel like that job really tends to attract a specific personality type (assholes and misogynists.) My dad was never abusive to me, but he treated my mom like a maid/chef/personal assistant. In general, an ambulance driver will be required to have some basic first aid and CPR type training, and they are often also licensed EMTs, but in many places in the US they do not have to be licensed EMTs. I'm sure you also don't have bus conductors? Folding and putting away is a part of doing laundry too. Haven’t heard that word in years. Yes. What does that mean? I have always felt that I am lucky to have him. He always thinks that I am the best at everything, trying to live up to his faith in me, has changed me into a better person. It’s wonderful being built up, instead of the pile of minced meat I used to be. Same! I honestly don't think I could be a SAHM . Kudos to all of you out there. It's the longest hardest day of work. I'm proud to still be here. In 2016, I almost gave up; but now I'm safe, got my dogs, live near family, and I try my best to help others. It's boggling that I let it go on as long as it did. The rose tinted glasses analogy is perfect. Shoot. Where can I find these women? 

I only get gold diggers where I live. Sounds like he's not even an EMT but just an ambulance driver. And the always on light Here is the book on the Internet Archive:


https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf I asked an honest question. No need to get all sarcastic. Apparently abusers aren't helped by therapy. I didn't know that. Now I do, but not because your comment informed me at all. Another's did. My arms are too weak to carry this meal u made to the microwave. I guess I'll pass out from hunger instead. Wtf. i mean, you do need to take the food in the fridge, open the microwave, put it in, and close it, which is a loooooooooooot of work, how is a busy man like him expected to do that?

/s Homeboy is gonna have plenty of practice pressing buttons on a microwave when OP dumps his ass. If he thinks using a microwave is too tough for him, I wonder how he handles grooming himself. Because clipping nails and shaving require a lot more effort than something that literally exists for people who need something convenient and quick. So... is OP also her husband's personal groomer? For sure! In the amount of time he spent yelling to wake her and waiting for her to come to where he was, he could have already reheated his meal and been halfway through eating it. He would be getting a cold PB and J from now on. Right like I would be so fucking excited if I got home from class and work and my boyfriend had put leftovers in the fridge so I could relax and just pop the food in the microwave. I'm not great at having energy to make food for myself and if not for serious differences in food preferences, he would 110% make sure I had food easily ready to go. If he's awake, he does help me immensely by getting something ready as I'm heading home. 

Side note about preferences: I'm so picky that my friend who works with children with special needs said one child with autism in the group is the only person on par with me in terms of pickiness because we have similar triggers. Also my boyfriend is vegetarian whereas I use meat as my primary protein source. So it's also not easy to prep food for me in advance lol

Anyways, OP is NTA but the grown man who has to loudly throw a fit over her being considerate and making sure he always has food ready and waiting for him in the fridge is the AH. 

Also if you read my comment, OP you deserve so much respect and praise for the hard work you do, and gratitude from your husband, and I'm sorry he didn't even recognize the work you put in to make sure he had food at any time of day.

(And apologies for the long comment; my ADHD meds haven't kicked in yet so I end up with long winded stories without even meaning to and half the time the whole point I wanted to make could be made in just a few sentences) But... there's so many buttons, and what if he breaks a nail?! Yes! My ex used to do this stuff to me since I worked nights and he worked days to trade off the kids. He would scream and scream at me and I would give into ANYTHING just to be able to go to sleep for a few hours. Omg. I can’t believe I never put that together about my ex.  Just as I would be falling asleep she would insist we have a conversation about something “important” until 2am. When I had 6am work wake up and she did not.  (She was a narcissist, and I thought I had puzzled most of her behaviors out. But.. man… another piece clicks. Thanks!) Oh my god. So, I got home from a 7 day stay in hospital and surgery and yesterday my current partner and I were meant to discord. I fell asleep from exhaustion and when I woke up it felt like hours of passed.

My partner just goes ""Hi!"" At the other end of the microphone and the sheer amount of terror I felt. The anxiety attack; a testament to how good my current boyfriend is. I was so terrified because my ex would have been angry. I wasn't thinking logically but it took a bit for my current partner to calm me down and make sure I knew he was just worried etc. Had to reassure me that I was allowed to sleep and he would do anything I needed.

It takes reading here for certain things to really sink in, your comment has given me a perspective that makes sense. The sad thing is that I gave it to my dad over my mum keeping him awake after night shifts. So thank you so much for giving me that perspective right when no matter how good my partner is, it sinks in why with being tired, I'm terrified. Thank you redditor! >it's easier to manipulate someone who can't think straight from exhaustion

Damn... suddenly my mom doing chores noisily at the wee hours of the morning in front of my bedroom (which didn't have a door) with bright lights on all the time, despite my pleas to let me sleep, make total sense. Yep. 

Been there. Same! My ah ex used to insist I stay up later than him, and wake up before him to make breakfast, lay out his clothes, and make a pack a lunch he may or may not touch. Even after I got a job and was working longer hours than him, I still needed to do that, and the chores, and have dinner on a plate for him when he walked in the door, even if I had just gotten off work. 

He would pre order like I was a resturant, tell me what I needed to make for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the next day, and how to make it (even if it was wrong). I remember one day cowering in the courner apologizing in tears while he yelled at me for being too useless to keep the house clean, I had failed to flip the couch and dust the underside. 

I didn't realize how scared I was to go home, and how I went into a panic attack whenever I headed him pull up because I could never seem to do everything right, untill he was arrested for unrelated things. I filed for divorce and got out. 

Op needs to contact a lawyer, and start getting things set to get out. Or hell, at this point, skip the lawyer and go straight for a domestic abuse hotline for emergency extraction for her and the kids. Been there as well. I’m a student who used to work nights full-time. My ex used to wake me up after 2 or 3 hours regularly. I felt like a zombie.

Did you know it’s illegal to deprive prisoners of sleep because that’s classified as a form of torture? Once I found that out, I realized just how badly he was treating me and got the hell out. A partner who cares won’t do crap like that. This!

My ex used to do this all the time too. You're much more inclined to just ""obey"" when exhausted and barely awake, or just plain tired.

They also love to make you drink too much or make you take drugs. Anything that improves their control over you.

I am siding with everyone else. This is not normal and obviously not a one time thing. This is abuse and it's only going to get worse.

Check out DoktorRamani on Youtube. She specializes on narcissists and does a real good job explaining how we get into a mindset of accepting the abuse and how to get out of it.

I was in that same relationship with a young child. It only gets worse. I've been free of him for almost 2 years now and the only regret I have is that I didn't leave sooner. Especially with a 3 year old (old enough to get into things, not old enough to necessarily catch that they shouldn't) and a 6 month old (so probably just started sleeping through the night). This, great point! He wants full control over her, and having her overworked, exhausted and sleep deprived makes her more compliant to take the abuse and not managing to think straight and making an exit plan. This man is abusive and abuse often escalates. It will get worse not only for the OP but also for the children. I hope the OP and the children can eventually get far away from this abusive man. This is extremely difficult for SAHM with several children as they're financially dependent on the abuser and have too much on their plate to reach out for help and leave. These abusive men be out here acting like they resent the fact that the woman being SAHM while they work, but they wish in fact to baby trap their wife and for her not to work to make her totally dependent on him so that he can exert full control. Sleep abuse.  So hot right now.  Literally.

got less than 4 hours sleep for 3+ months with my kids. I had similar with a friend's kid when she had to stay at my place after her husband almost beat her to death. Took us 2 months to get her a place to live and it was rough, but she needed help and I had room. AND I WASN'T EVEN RELATED TO HER!

Bf arguing with me about my sleep and how much time he needs from me : relationship_advice
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/st3hyj/bf_arguing_with_me_about_my_sleep_and_how_much/.compact She’s really taking care of three small children, if you think about it. OP’s husband is as infantile as they come. He wakes her up screaming in the middle of the night to be fed and she’s under constant pressure to care for his needs. My friend's boyfriend worked a 12 hour shift in A&E and then drove to pick her up from the pub where we all were. He sat and talked to us for half an hour before gently suggesting that it was time to go home. 

Working shifts doesn't mean you get the right to treat your partner like crap. OP's husband is an abusive baby-man. Some people can take it other people can't honestly it sounds like he's getting burned out and taking it out on his wife. Which is NOT OK.  But I have a feeling this is the major issue here. Or, when I come home late at night after work, if I'm ""too tired"" to handle the microwave, I eat something that doesn't require heat - usually a snack or something  - not a full, hot meal.  I don't expect my husband to come downstairs and heat something up.  If I do want something more substantial, I'll do it myself or just have something to tide me over.  Also, what does this dude do on his lunch/dinner breaks? Expect his boss to heat up his meals? I wouldn’t actually do this - but, all he deserves is those baby food packets because apparently he’s just a big baby. Those don’t even need heated. Granted, he probably can’t even open them on his own, since he’s a big dumb baby. He accuses her of being petty to prove a point. No, he is the one voluntarily going hungry to prove a point. The level of projection is unbelievable Hell, a lot of foods can be eaten cold if he's so sure he's about to ""pass out from hunger""

It's a power play, pure and simple. Or eat it cold! Or go and buy fast food like there's a million option  
NTA  
This man is insane, either run or get some help Hate to tell him, but there are actually EMTs who are SINGLE and have to deal with cooking for themselves!

NTA big time. Honestly, given the amount of time before he came to bed, I would bet he did eat, and is just claiming otherwise to make her feel bad. Bold of you to assume that he would do *anything* with respect to the kids Don't be ridiculous. He's a MAN, that's women's work!  


To be clear, I'm a man, and any job that needs doing is men's work. I was going to say IF he even does anything for the children Absolutely this too!

She, whilst not necessarily earning, is working too (although I bet he won't see it that way)
And ok.. he's doing a demanding job.. but he's asking her to sacrifice her health at his beck and call.. essentially she has a 24/7 job with a 24/7 hr call out..
That is beyond acceptable.

How OP had lasted this long is beyond me.

That he's acting like a controlling and demanding / entitled 'child' is concerning.
HE was being petty by starving himself whilst food was clearly available, HE made that choice.. and that he's willing to blame her indicates narcissistic tenancies..
Wouldn't put it past him to be gas lighting her for other things too.. but that's me being unfairly judgemental..

OP NTA.. but please do follow the advice to get further support and guidance..

(Edit.. Couple of auto correct mishaps.. Corrected) > Taking care of house and kids is work. Hard work. He thinks it's nothing.

Because it *is* nothing, for him. At some point you made him feel it was OK to act like this just start working on a new set of standards and if he can’t deal start working on a new situation for yourself you are totally NTA 😊👍 All because daddy is a bigger baby than the 6 month old. They absolutely were scared. That was my mother.  I can't count the number of times I cried into my pillow from the sheer terror of the way she screamed at my father after we kids were sent to bed.  As if, somehow, our being in bed meant that we wouldn't hear the screaming?  I'm still traumatized. Yes, it is. It's called blame-shifting, which is a form of gaslighting.

""Blame-shifting is another common gaslighting tactic. Every discussion you have is somehow twisted to where you are to blame for something that occurred. Even when you try to discuss how the abuser's behavior makes you feel, they're able to twist the conversation so that you end up questioning if you are the cause of their bad behavior. For example, they may claim that if only you behaved differently, they would not treat you the way that they do.""

https://www.verywellmind.com/is-someone-gaslighting-you-4147470 I think OP should use this very scenario when she talks to him. ""I DID cook you meals, all you have to do is stick them in the microwave. Instead, you WOKE ME UP because you're that helpless? Do you want me to start wiping your ass too? You chose me as your wife, why would you treat me like this?"" Man I’m about at that level when I realize I cool enough MYSELF to be able to reheat shit, if someone made it FOR ME I think I would die because I don’t have to do anything! Right?? I wouldn’t even care if I ate it cold, I’d be so grateful! You know he complains about bringing home that paycheck, too. The vibe is that he is insulted that anybody could even *think* that he would or should help with anything. Umm **EXCUSE ME** but some microwaves even require **multiple** buttons to be pressed just to get that food heated. 

Not to **mention** that he’d have to both open AND shut the microwave door — ***TWICE**(!!!). omg ***AND*** lift the plate into and out of that microwave. 

I bet you think he should get his own fork out of the drawer, too. 

What are you, some kind of sadist?? 
^/s Waking the kids up will just be another level of control. He can eat and go to bed and leave her up to deal with getting the kids back to sleep. He’s abusing her. That is a good (and scary) point. Yes, never a bad idea at all. The dude you’re responding to probably does “laundry” by washing and drying a mixed load of random stuff and leaving it in the dryer for someone else to deal with while thanking him for his sacrifice. Deny, Attack, Reverse the Victim and Offender.

Basically gaslighting and projection It's an acronym that stands for: Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. ""How could you say I did X?! You're the one who did X! I'm the one who is the victim of X here!"" I couldn’t even be an M! Too much. you are disgusting When we remodeled our kitchen, we added a switch for the microwave so we can turn it off and leave the door open. Thank you!! Apparently he can lift patients but not a plate into the microwave. I mean, I’ve been sore and tired after a shift (am EMS as well, er ‘ambulance driver’) but this pooooor man! /s I had said to my exfiancé when he tried to pull this kind of needy gaslighting “well i guess you should call your mommy to come do it for you, because I’m not your mom or your servant and you’re a fully capable adult man” he went to work and complained to his married boss who told him to grow up and do it himself. So validating. We were mid 20’s at the time. YES ! Lol 100% YES Right? If he's so tired he can't even do that, what else did he expect? For OP to feed him like he's a baby? With little airplane noises? I have lots of trauma around food preparation—I have been physically attacked over it before! (I was unfortunate to have both an eating disorder and parents who were traumatized by their parents’ mental illnesses and reacted to triggers with violence.)
 It’s really hard for me to even put anything in the microwave, but I can manage to not scream at my fiancée while she’s sleeping to come do it for me. What’s this guy’s excuse? And after she reheats it for him, she has to stand next to him and spoon each bite into his mouth, too? I'm imaging a 2-3 year old doing this while slowly dropping to the floor Fuck sakes, how helpless does one have to be to not be able or willing to reheat some food? It’s like the easiest thing, ever. She didn’t ask him took cook his own meal. And to choose to starve rather than take the 3-5 minutes to do it. Ugh. I'm always shocked at the number of grown men who pretend they can't possibly feed themselves as a means to control and enslave women! My ADHD husband has always preferred to heat up a can and eat it rather than wait for what I'm cooking to be ready! Then he can reheat my leftovers when he's ready to eat latter. And this guy's attitude that he worked all day and acting like his wife did not, just made my blood boil! This man is a big bullying baby! I feel bad for this lady, that she chose him to have a family with. It’s amazing how easy it is to control us when we’re exhausted, isn’t it? Glad he’s you’re ex. Mine is too. Yeah I feel you. my ex would do this even though I was all doing all the night feeds and housework AND I have M.E.  He is now using my medical problems to lie and say I am an unfit mother to the courts and claiming (lying through his rotten teeth)he did all the childrearing ,  housework while working 12+ work shifts, because apparently he has harnessed the ability to time travel, clone himself to do all this 🙄 

Like OP mine would throw a FIT if his demands weren't fulfilled upon arriving from work, after all surviving on minimal sleep,  doing upwards of twelve hour days, having multiple medical problems , nearly dying having our LO and having surgery to save me which took months to heal and having PND wasn't as hard as his job and he still wouldn't do any night feeds even with my doctors telling him it was dangerous for me if I didn't rest...OP your husband is exactly the same, >Yes! My ex used to do this stuff to me since I worked nights and he worked days to trade off the kids. He would scream and scream at me and I would give into ANYTHING just to be able to go to sleep for a few hours.

As someone with sleep issues, the idea of someone purposefully keeping me from sleep is enraging Oh my god. I just realized that's what my ex would do to me. Wow. Woooooow. 

And then he'd yell at me for taking naps when I'd try to catch some zzz's in between going to college and working. While he was unemployed.

Jesus.

ETA: We've been apart for like 8 or 9 years, but I've never realized the intention behind fucking up my sleep. Jesus….that sounds awful ! I’m sorry…😔 There's a classic N maneuver.  I got the same treatment, and it always came with a sort of petty, ""well, if \*I\* have to be up and doing chores, then \*you\* should have to be up and doing chores"" kind of huffiness.  Because it's \*obviously\* unfair that an adult who chose to have children is being used by them at ages 6 & 8 as their personal servant... how dare they!  They should get their lazy little butts out of bed and get to work! If this was a new behavior I'd agree but it looks like from the post he's been treating her like this for years and she finally tried to change it because she couldn't handle it anymore. He seems really demanding and controlling, IMO. If you're a gremlin like me sometimes you just eat the cold leftovers, because you have no respect for yourself I've eaten plenty of random-ass snack meals when I was too tired/lazy to heat up leftovers, and so has my spouse. Handful of nuts and some swigs of kefir directly from the container, hunk of whatever amount of cheese comes off when I tear at it plus a pickle, dry cheerios and some leftover carrot sticks from my kid's plate from lord only knows how many hours ago.

I suppose if my husband had managed to break *both* his thumbs at once I'd accept waking up to help him get fed, and I still certainly wouldn't tolerate screaming about it. Nah. He complains to them about his Wife so that they feel sorry for him and side with his frustrations. Goes out and buys food, still complaining to everyone. Open up - here comes the choo-choo.  *waves spoon* Like this

3 jars of baby food on the table with a note

""Here is your dinner, ready to eat, no prep required. OR you can slam one of the ready made meals currently in the fridge in the microwave for 3 minutes. Your choice"" No, no... the level of projection is *perfectly* believable.  Absolutely classic narcissistic behavior.  (Which I know you know, but I had to say it.) Tohhhhtally. There should be virtual reality programs where people experience life from another person's POV. Like a Black Mirror episode... Do you need me to CHEW it for you?? You are of course correct. Clearly you’ll only be eating raw batter on your cake day! ;) people fight during stressful moments. a good recommendation would be to talk it out and meet in the middle. Try to see eye to eye, but this is a fight about food. Could be resolved easily. People don't need to be so soft that's how u get walked over in the first place. Thanks!!! And thanks for helping me clarify it That guy also throws bras in the dryer and gets mad when he has to replace what he ruined Hey now, he doesn’t JUST have to put the plate in the microwave.  He also has to push a few buttons……. Wait, what…… huh.  What a craptastic power play by the crappy husband. Depending on where you're at there really are positions that are just ambulance drivers. Around here they do convalescent transport like people that need dialysis and such. You have to have a valid driver's license, take a BLS class to be CPR certified, and be able to help with lifting assistance. They are partnered with an EMT or Paramedic but don't do patient care. Ambulance driver doesn’t sound that hard tbh. It’s not like he’s an emt. And even if he were an emt that doesn’t excuse his temper tantrum “Ex fiancé.” Smart 👍🏼 His boss is great. 😎 >	he went to work and complained to his married boss who told him to grow up and do it himself. 

Excuse me? I mean boss response was cool but are people really running to their bosses about this kind of stuff? lol I remember a post on here a couple of years ago where the wife was the sahm and one night her partner came home and told her to make him something to eat. I can't remember the full details but either she told him to heat something up or he didn't like what she made but this part I definitely remember. She took the food and split it into the two dog bowls, which the dogs loved and she went back to bed. It was both petty and perfect. 

They ended up having a discussion the next day and she made it clear that while she's the sahm and is happy to cook and do chores, he is not to disrespect/take advantage of her like that. They had a good long chat and he ended up taking a more active role in the kids lives as well, like taking them to sports etc. 

Somehow I don't think op is going to have a happy ending like this. Her partner has got used to her being his servant and he has zero respect for her. I definitely think they need couple's counselling but I don't know if he will go for that. He could be the type to dig his heels in and say that because he provides the money, she should provide everything else without question. Obviously we know that's bs and unrealistic but he's not going to want to give up his sweet deal. If he doesn't get his head out of his ass, sooner or later op will snap and divorce him. I immediately thought to myself that he'd run in to work and tell his co-workers about how his wife ""disrespected him"" and wondering if his co-workers would tell him that he's an asshole for not doing it himself when reheating a meal is probably as simple as taking off a lid or plastic wrap, putting the meal in the microwave and pressing a button! So happy to read exfiancé, it seems too many women experience  that behaviour from a male parter and stay, expecting things to magically improve. Fucking right! Hell yeah girl. I got out of a marriage to an adult child, can’t even feed himself I don’t know about your ex, but my partner’s mommy would have told him to stop being lazy and entitled! ""Here comes the ambulance!"" That sucks I'm sorry. My friend had food trauma from childhood too. Led to EDs. I too have EDs. Once I was eating so little my mom asked how I was still able to walk. Lol. I know it makes u weak if ur not used to it but hard to believe he is too weak to nuke a meal. I mean that's when u go to the hospital. And I've been there too and I was able to walk. Lol. Can you use that old feedback from your doctors to support your case in court? I'm thinking of my SO, who got alerted that one of our outbuildings was on fire, rushed out to check, called the Fire Brigade, turned the garden hose on the fire and only when the firefighters arrived came and woke me up. Bless. Me too! Mine used to argue that looking after five children (four under school age) was nowhere NEAR as hard as going to work for eight hours (doing a mostly desk bound scientific job). I used to say 'at least you can go to the toilet on your own!' and he would counter with 'I may as well have them all come with me, they can't do anything on their own!'.

Nope, mate, not even close to being the same as having to have the baby in the room with you and then try to wee with three others kicking at the door the whole time... Yeah I didn’t realize it at the time either. We’ve been apart for almost 3 years now and it wasn’t until about a year ago that I realized exactly how messed up it was and how he used my sleep deprivation for his own purposes. I’m sorry it happened to you too but I’m glad he’s gone! 100% upvote - cold pizza though usually hits the spot! Sorry but this made me literally LOL! My mom used to be so mad when we'd drink out of the milk jug, but ha hah Mom, I can do what I want now! She'd also do the same thing herself, and when ""caught,"" she'd say ""do as I say, not as I do."" Only if someone else makes it and I’m spoon-fed! :) I’m an AEMT and part of my job description is “ambulance attendant,” and I was an EMR for 4 years before I got my EMT. Some EMS folks get really crabby about being called an ambulance driver, I just think it’s hilarious. And if this guy is such a dick to his wife, I really hope he’s just an ambulance driver and doesn’t have much patient contact!

I work super rural and usually partner with an EMT or another AEMT. We do have a couple EMRs that pretty much are just drivers and lift help. But unlike this dude, they’re caring and lovely people. I hope he’s just a driver, I wouldn’t want that dude having contact with any of my patients! This was a few years before the end and his boss had periodically pulled me aside at their work events and told me it was okay to leave. I was young and stupid and should’ve seen the lifeline being tossed to me. I still see his now ex boss through my own job and I’ve thanked him a few times for trying to pull the hood from my eyes and help me. he prob thought the boss will agree as a married man (""females being females amirite"") but he didn't realized the boss is much more mature than him lol Yep. He was about 24/25 at the time. It was specifically about how I didn’t spend all my evenings ironing or steaming his shirts prior to his workday since they were all wrinkly from hanging in the closet. I also worked full time.

He thought his boss would sympathize because his wife was a SAHM and did the lions share of the housework. We train people how to treat us. Sometimes we are willing to do more and say less for people we love, but that should never mean being taken advantage of. The minute the recipient is ungrateful, it’s the minute they no longer deserve the act of service as a favour IMO. It’s a long story but we did counselling and nothing improved. Ultimately I made the choice to break it off. Was the hardest but the best decision I’ve ever made. Lost my 20’s to someone undeserving but I learned a lot along the way and ended up with a person who amazes and appreciates me everyday. Life works out. Wow, kudos to that guy for real. Nice. 🙂 U dodged a bullet. Yeah good egg."
