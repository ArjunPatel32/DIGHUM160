       "['My girlfriend recently went to the beach with a few of her friends.  She has this tiny bikini bottom that is basically a thong that I HATE when she wears in public.  Well she wore it.  Not only did she wear it, she posed in the bathroom mirror of her hotel room to take a side profile picture so you could see her ass sticking out in it and posted it to her Snapchat story.   Worth mentioning I am not friends with her on Snapchat for reasons similar to this (sick of getting in fights when she says she\\'s going out for \\'girls\\' night then posts videos of her sitting at a table with like 5 dudes that always got invited by one of the other girls which was completely unknown to her until she arrived - most of these guys she then adds on Snapchat afterwards).  She didn\\'t even save it and send it to me.  I saw it when she was showing me pics from her beach trip and she had screenshot that particular snap and left it in her camera roll.  Whether the ass part was intentional or not I will never know.  She claims she just liked the way her stomach looked and it was just a pic because she was at the beach and that was the only black bikini bottom she owns.  But there\\'s nothing to look at but her in a micro bikini in a bathroom mirror.  There\\'s no ocean, no sand, no friends, just her tits and ass in a bathroom mirror.  She\\'s 24 and I am 30.  Is it the age?  Is this typical 24 year old behavior nowadays?  Am I wrong for thinking this is inappropriate behavior when you\\'re in a relationship or am I the asshole for making a big deal about it?\\n\\n\\n**Edit:**  Guys, let me clear.  I did not try to control her at any point in time.  I have never once told her what to do, what to wear, what she can or can not do.  Yes, I hate that her ass is completely out in that bikini.  But I\\'ve never told her not to wear it and my problem is not that she wore it in general.  She wore it all summer long despite my groaning.  That was never my issue.  I found it super annoying yes but my issue is that she sent out a picture of her ass on Snapchat.  Plain and simple.  That\\'s where I drew the line.  I didn\\'t break it off because she wore it, I broke it off because she turned sideways in a bathroom mirror stuck her butt out, took a picture and sent it out on Snapchat.  It\\'s a borderline nude in that suit and seems wildly inappropriate to me.  Also for clarity I am not jealous.  The friends she went to the beach with were guy friends.  I was completely ok with it.  I had never even met them before.   She has guy friends.  She hangs out with them.  Never my issue and I didn\\'t even feel it was worth mentioning.  My issue with the whole girls night comes into play when I get explicitly told I cannot come because it is girls only night, then later find out it was just a bunch of dudes and her and her girlfriend.  That\\'s not a trust thing and I didn\\'t try to make a big deal about it I just removed her from my friends on Snapchat so I didn\\'t have to see it anymore.  And in all honesty my only true problem with it was one guy that was there in particular.  He\\'s been hitting on her and messaging her non stop since we started dating knowing she has a boyfriend.  Both times I got snubbed for \\'girls night\\', this one particular fella was in attendance both nights and I got the \"I didn\\'t know he was going to be there\" from her.  But again whatever she can do whatever she wants whenever she wants and I\\'ve never tried to stop her but for my own sanity I removed her from Snapchat so I didn\\'t have to see it.  That wasn\\'t the point in this post and that wasn\\'t even why I dumped her so I didn\\'t really want to get into detail on that but a few people are calling me controlling and jealous now.  I broke it off because she sent out a pic of her ass on Snapchat.  The only reason we were together is because SHE told me the wild party phase was done and she was looking to start a family and have a serious relationship.  She is a single mom of an almost 3 year old daughter who I love to pieces.  She has been chasing me for 2 years trying to date me and I told her no every step of the way because she was just a little to wild for what I\\'m looking for in the stage I\\'m at in life.  So when she came to me earlier this year saying she had matured, all the partying and wild stuff was done and she was ready to get serious and start a family with me, I agreed to commit.  I did not date this woman and say \"HEY PUT ON SOME PANTS\".  I simply said \"you told me this stuff was over and I told you from the very beginning I had no interest in dating a girl who\\'s still stuck in the wild college party phase\" so I ended it.  If she hadn\\'t told me she had matured and wanted to get serious I never would have agreed to date her to begin with.  That\\'s just not what I\\'m looking for.  I don\\'t think that makes me jealous or controlling.  I was very open and honest about what I was looking for the 2 years I\\'ve known her.  ',\n",
       " 'I think you definitely made the right decision.',\n",
       " \"I think you are being a bit controlling. You were fine with her wearing the bikini but not taking photos of it? She's not allowed to have male friends she spends time with? You want to control what she wears and who she spends time with. That's not a good attitude to have in a relationship. You just don't trust her not to cheat on you. That's also not a great attitude. So, yeah. Kinda a asshole. \",\n",

       "'My girlfriend recently went to the beach with a few of her friends.  She has this tiny bikini bottom that is basically a thong that I HATE when she wears in public.  Well she wore it.  Not only did she wear it, she posed in the bathroom mirror of her hotel room to take a side profile picture so you could see her ass sticking out in it and posted it to her Snapchat story.   Worth mentioning I am not friends with her on Snapchat for reasons similar to this (sick of getting in fights when she says she\\'s going out for \\'girls\\' night then posts videos of her sitting at a table with like 5 dudes that always got invited by one of the other girls which was completely unknown to her until she arrived - most of these guys she then adds on Snapchat afterwards).  She didn\\'t even save it and send it to me.  I saw it when she was showing me pics from her beach trip and she had screenshot that particular snap and left it in her camera roll.  Whether the ass part was intentional or not I will never know.  She claims she just liked the way her stomach looked and it was just a pic because she was at the beach and that was the only black bikini bottom she owns.
