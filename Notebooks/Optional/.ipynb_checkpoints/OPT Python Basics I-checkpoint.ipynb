Python is a very robust and very popular language, which is why we have chosen to learn it on our course.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also insert cells using the `Insert` menu, and move them up and down relative to one another using the <i class=\"fa-arrow-up fa\"></i> and <i class=\"fa-arrow-down fa\"></i> buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, notebooks like these run on what's called a Kernel. Sometimes this kernel breaks or stops functioning. In such cases, you'll want to Restart it. Do this by clicking the `Kernel` menu and clicking the `Restart` button.\n",

    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also find that a lot of cells have comments in them. A comment is a note we leave for ourselves when writing code, explaining what we're thinking or doing. Python ignores these comments entirely, so we can write in human languages.\n",
