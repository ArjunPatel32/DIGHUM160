       "['My girlfriend recently went to the beach with a few of her friends  She has this tiny bikini bottom that is basically a thong that I HATE when she wears in public  Well she wore it  Not only did she wear it she posed in the bathroom mirror of her hotel room to take a side profile picture so you could see her ass sticking out in it and posted it to her Snapchat story   Worth mentioning I am not friends with her on Snapchat for reasons similar to this sick of getting in fights when she says shes going out for girls night then posts videos of her sitting at a table with like 5 dudes that always got invited by one of the other girls which was completely unknown to her until she arrived  most of these guys she then adds on Snapchat afterwards  She didnt even save it and send it to me  I saw it when she was showing me pics from her beach trip and she had screenshot that particular snap and left it in her camera roll  Whether the ass part was intentional or not I will never know  She claims she just liked the way her stomach looked and it was just a pic because she was at the beach and that was the only black bikini bottom she owns  But theres nothing to look at but her in a micro bikini in a bathroom mirror  Theres no ocean no sand no friends just her tits and ass in a bathroom mirror  Shes 24 and I am 30  Is it the age  Is this typical 24 year old behavior nowadays  Am I wrong for thinking this is inappropriate behavior when youre in a relationship or am I the asshole for making a big deal about it\\n\\n\\nEdit  Guys let me clear  I did not try to control her at any point in time  I have never once told her what to do what to wear what she can or can not do  Yes I hate that her ass is completely out in that bikini  But Ive never told her not to wear it and my problem is not that she wore it in general  She wore it all summer long despite my groaning  That was never my issue  I found it super annoying yes but my issue is that she sent out a picture of her ass on Snapchat  Plain and simple  Thats where I drew the line  I didnt break it off because she wore it I broke it off because she turned sideways in a bathroom mirror stuck her butt out took a picture and sent it out on Snapchat  Its a borderline nude in that suit and seems wildly inappropriate to me  Also for clarity I am not jealous  The friends she went to the beach with were guy friends  I was completely ok with it  I had never even met them before   She has guy friends  She hangs out with them  Never my issue and I didnt even feel it was worth mentioning  My issue with the whole girls night comes into play when I get explicitly told I cannot come because it is girls only night then later find out it was just a bunch of dudes and her and her girlfriend  Thats not a trust thing and I didnt try to make a big deal about it I just removed her from my friends on Snapchat so I didnt have to see it anymore  And in all honesty my only true problem with it was one guy that was there in particular  Hes been hitting on her and messaging her non stop since we started dating knowing she has a boyfriend  Both times I got snubbed for girls night this one particular fella was in attendance both nights and I got the I didnt know he was going to be there from her  But again whatever she can do whatever she wants whenever she wants and Ive never tried to stop her but for my own sanity I removed her from Snapchat so I didnt have to see it  That wasnt the point in this post and that wasnt even why I dumped her so I didnt really want to get into detail on that but a few people are calling me controlling and jealous now  I broke it off because she sent out a pic of her ass on Snapchat  The only reason we were together is because SHE told me the wild party phase was done and she was looking to start a family and have a serious relationship  She is a single mom of an almost 3 year old daughter who I love to pieces  She has been chasing me for 2 years trying to date me and I told her no every step of the way because she was just a little to wild for what Im looking for in the stage Im at in life  So when she came to me earlier this year saying she had matured all the partying and wild stuff was done and she was ready to get serious and start a family with me I agreed to commit  I did not date this woman and say HEY PUT ON SOME PANTS  I simply said you told me this stuff was over and I told you from the very beginning I had no interest in dating a girl whos still stuck in the wild college party phase so I ended it  If she hadnt told me she had matured and wanted to get serious I never would have agreed to date her to begin with  Thats just not what Im looking for  I dont think that makes me jealous or controlling  I was very open and honest about what I was looking for the 2 years Ive known her  ',\n",
